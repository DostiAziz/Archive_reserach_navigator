TITLE: On Turán problems for suspension hypergraphs
AUTHORS: Xin Cheng, Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim, Junpeng Zhou
ABSTRACT: Title: On Turán problems for suspension hypergraphs
Abstract: For a given graph $F$, the $r$-uniform suspension of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by taking $r-2$ new vertices and adding them to every edge. In this paper, we consider Tur\'{a}n problems on suspension hypergraphs, and we obtain several general and exact results.

[PAPER 2]
TITLE: Generalized regular Turán numbers
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim
ABSTRACT: Title: Generalized regular Turán numbers
Abstract: We combine two generalizations of ordinary Tur\'an problems. Given graphs $H$ and $F$ and a positive integer $n$, we study $rex(n, H, F )$, which is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $F$-free regular $n$-vertex graphs.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Planar Turán Numbers of Cycles: A Counterexample
AUTHORS: Daniel W. Cranston, Bernard Lidický, Xiaonan Liu, Abhinav Shantanam
ABSTRACT: Abstract: The planar Turan number $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ is the largest number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph with no $\ell$-cycle. For $\ell\in \{3,4,5,6\}$, upper bounds on $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ are known that hold with equality infinitely often. Ghosh, Gy\"{o}ri, Martin, Paulo, and Xiao [arxiv:2004.14094] conjectured an upper bound on $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ for every $\ell\ge 7$ and $n$ sufficiently large. We disprove this conjecture for every $\ell\ge 11$. We also propose two revised versions of the conjecture.

TITLE: Exact formulae and Turán inequalities for Vafa-Witten invariants of

AUTHORS: Daniel R. Johnston, Joshua Males
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We consider three different families of Vafa-Witten invariants of $K3$ surfaces. In each case, the partition function that encodes the Vafa-Witten invariants is given by combinations of twisted Dedekind $\eta$-functions. By utilising known properties of these $\eta$-functions, we obtain exact formulae for each of the invariants and prove that they asymptotically satisfy all higher-order Tur\'{a}n inequalities.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: On hypergraph Turán problems with bounded matching number
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Casey Tompkins, Junpeng Zhou
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Very recently, Alon and Frankl, and Gerbner studied the maximum number of edges in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs with bounded matching number, respectively. We consider the analogous Tur\'{a}n problems on hypergraphs with bounded matching number, and we obtain some exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 2]
TITLE: Generalized Turán problems for small graphs
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $ex(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We consider this problem when both $H$ and $F$ have at most four vertices. We give sharp results in almost all cases, and connect the remaining cases to well-known unsolved problems. Our main new contribution is applying the progressive induction method of Simonovits for generalized Tur\'an problems.
================================================================================

[PAPER 3]
TITLE: On Turán problems for suspension hypergraphs
AUTHORS: Xin Cheng, Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim, Junpeng Zhou
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For a given graph $F$, the $r$-uniform suspension of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by taking $r-2$ new vertices and adding them to every edge. In this paper, we consider Tur\'{a}n problems on suspension hypergraphs, and we obtain several general and exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 4]
TITLE: On the extremal graphs in generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. For every $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, we present an extremal graph for a generalized Tur\'an problem, i.e., an $F$-free $n$ vertex graph $G$ that for some $H$ contains exactly $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$.
================================================================================

[PAPER 5]
TITLE: On generalized Turán problems with bounded matching number
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given a graph $H$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graphs that do not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Recently there has been interest in studying the case $\mathcal{F}=\{F,M_{s+1}\}$ for arbitrary $F$ and $H=K_r$. We extend these investigations to the case $H$ is arbitrary as well.
================================================================================

[PAPER 6]
TITLE: Some stability and exact results in generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Stability refers to the usual phenomenon that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains almost $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$, than $G$ is in some sense similar to some extremal graph. We obtain new stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems and derive several new exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 7]
TITLE: Survey of generalized Turán problems -- counting subgraphs
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Cory Palmer
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For fixed graphs $H$ and $F$, the \emph{generalized Tur\'an number} $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum possible number of copies of a subgraph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. This article is a survey of this extremal function whose study was initiated in an influential 2016 article by Alon and Shikhelman (\emph{J. Combin. Theory, B}, {\bf 121}, 2016).
================================================================================

[PAPER 8]
TITLE: A note on the Turán number of a Berge odd cycle
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: In this note we obtain upper bounds on the number of hyperedges in 3-uniform hypergraphs not containing a Berge cycle of given odd length. We improve the bound given by F\"uredi and \"Ozkahya in 2017. The result follows from a more general theorem. We also obtain some new results for Berge cliques.
================================================================================

[PAPER 9]
TITLE: Generalized regular Turán numbers
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We combine two generalizations of ordinary Tur\'an problems. Given graphs $H$ and $F$ and a positive integer $n$, we study $rex(n, H, F )$, which is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $F$-free regular $n$-vertex graphs.
================================================================================

[PAPER 10]
TITLE: Paths are Turán-good
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We show that among $K_{k+1}$-free $n$-vertex graphs, the Tur\'an graph contains the most copies of any path.
================================================================================

[PAPER 11]
TITLE: Some exact results for non-degenerate generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We consider the case where $\chi(H)<\chi(F)$. There are several exact results on $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ when the extremal graph is a complete $(\chi(F)-1)$-partite graph. We obtain multiple exact results with other kinds of extremal graphs.
================================================================================

[PAPER 12]
TITLE: Generalized Turán results for matchings
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We study the case when either $H$ or $F$ is a matching. We obtain several asymptotic and exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 13]
TITLE: Generalized Turán problems for complete bipartite graphs
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Balázs Patkós
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For graph $G$, $F$ and integer $n$, the generalized Tu\'an number $ex(n,G,F)$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $G$ that an $F$-free $n$-vertex graph can have. We study this parameter when both $G$ and $F$ are complete bipartite graphs.
================================================================================

[PAPER 14]
TITLE: On Turán problems with bounded matching number
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Very recently, Alon and Frankl initiated the study of the maximum number of edges in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs with matching number at most $s$. For fixed $F$ and $s$, we determine this number apart from a constant additive term. We also obtain several exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 15]
TITLE: Generalized Turán problems for $K_{2,t}$
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We study the generalized Tur\'an function $ex(n,H,F)$, when $H$ or $F$ is $K_{2,t}$. We determine the order of magnitude of $ex(n,H,K_{2,t})$ when $H$ is a tree, and determine its asymptotics for a large class of trees. We also determine the asymptotics of $ex(n,K_{2,t},H)$ in most cases.
================================================================================

[PAPER 16]
TITLE: Some exact results for regular Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Balázs Patkós, Zsolt Tuza, Máté Vizer
ABSTRACT: Abstract: As a variant of the famous Tur\'an problem, we study $\mathrm{rex}(n,F)$, the maximum number of edges that an $n$-vertex regular graph can have without containing a copy of $F$. We determine $\mathrm{rex}(n,K_{r+1})$ for all pairs of integers $r$ and large enough $n$. For every tree $T$, we determine $\mathrm{rex}(n,T)$ for every $n$ large enough.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Generalized Turán problems for small graphs
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $ex(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We consider this problem when both $H$ and $F$ have at most four vertices. We give sharp results in almost all cases, and connect the remaining cases to well-known unsolved problems. Our main new contribution is applying the progressive induction method of Simonovits for generalized Tur\'an problems.

[PAPER 2]
TITLE: On Turán problems for suspension hypergraphs
AUTHORS: Xin Cheng, Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim, Junpeng Zhou
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For a given graph $F$, the $r$-uniform suspension of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by taking $r-2$ new vertices and adding them to every edge. In this paper, we consider Tur\'{a}n problems on suspension hypergraphs, and we obtain several general and exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 3]
TITLE: On hypergraph Turán problems with bounded matching number
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Casey Tompkins, Junpeng Zhou
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Very recently, Alon and Frankl, and Gerbner studied the maximum number of edges in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs with bounded matching number, respectively. We consider the analogous Tur\'{a}n problems on hypergraphs with bounded matching number, and we obtain some exact results.
================================================================================

[PAPER 4]
TITLE: On generalized Turán problems with bounded matching number
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given a graph $H$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graphs that do not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Recently there has been interest in studying the case $\mathcal{F}=\{F,M_{s+1}\}$ for arbitrary $F$ and $H=K_r$. We extend these investigations to the case $H$ is arbitrary as well.
================================================================================

[PAPER 5]
TITLE: Generalized regular Turán numbers
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Hilal Hama Karim
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We combine two generalizations of ordinary Tur\'an problems. Given graphs $H$ and $F$ and a positive integer $n$, we study $rex(n, H, F )$, which is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $F$-free regular $n$-vertex graphs.
================================================================================

[PAPER 6]
TITLE: Some exact results for non-degenerate generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We consider the case where $\chi(H)<\chi(F)$. There are several exact results on $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ when the extremal graph is a complete $(\chi(F)-1)$-partite graph. We obtain multiple exact results with other kinds of extremal graphs.

AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Stability refers to the usual phenomenon that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains almost $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$, than $G$ is in some sense similar to some extremal graph. We obtain new stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems and derive several new exact results.

AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. For every $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, we present an extremal graph for a generalized Tur\'an problem, i.e., an $F$-free $n$ vertex graph $G$ that for some $H$ contains exactly $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$.

[PAPER 9]
TITLE: A note on the Turán number of a Berge odd cycle
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: In this note we obtain upper bounds on the number of hyperedges in 3-uniform hypergraphs not containing a Berge cycle of given odd length. We improve the bound given by F\"uredi and \"Ozkahya in 2017. The result follows from a more general theorem. We also obtain some new results for Berge cliques.

AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Balázs Patkós
ABSTRACT: Abstract: For graph $G$, $F$ and integer $n$, the generalized Tu\'an number $ex(n,G,F)$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $G$ that an $F$-free $n$-vertex graph can have. We study this parameter when both $G$ and $F$ are complete bipartite graphs.

TITLE: Generalized Turán problems for $K_{2,t}$
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Abstract: We study the generalized Tur\'an function $ex(n,H,F)$, when $H$ or $F$ is $K_{2,t}$. We determine the order of magnitude of $ex(n,H,K_{2,t})$ when $H$ is a tree, and determine its asymptotics for a large class of trees.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Deriving formal bounds on the expressivity of transformers, as well as studying transformers that are constructed to implement known algorithms, are both effective methods for better understanding the computational power of transformers. Towards both ends, we introduce the temporal counting logic $\textsf{K}_\text{t}$[#] alongside the RASP variant $\textsf{C-RASP}$. We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size.

Agents reflect on their behavior to reason and develop new personality traits. These traits, in turn, generate new behavior patterns, forming a feedback loop-like personality evolution. Our experiment utilized a simulation platform with ten agents for evaluation. During the assessment, these agents experienced believable and inspirational personality evolution.

However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.', 'metadata': {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01463v1', 'authors': 'V.

Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation.

The layer counter-acts the emergent incentive of advanced agents to resist such alteration. A detailed model for agents which can reason about preserving their utility function is developed, and used to prove that the corrigibility layer works as intended in a large set of non-hostile universes. The corrigible agents have an emergent incentive to protect key elements of their corrigibility layer. However, hostile universes may contain forces strong enough to break safety features. Some open problems related to graceful degradation when an agent is successfully attacked are identified. The results in this paper were obtained by concurrently developing an AGI agent simulator, an agent model, and proofs. The simulator is available under an open source license.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Evolving Agents: Interactive Simulation of Dynamic and Diverse Human
  Personalities
AUTHORS: Jiale Li, Jiayang Li, Jiahao Chen, Yifan Li, Shijie Wang, Hugo Zhou, Minjun Ye, Yunsheng Su
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Human-like Agents with diverse and dynamic personalities could serve as an essential design probe in the process of user-centered design, thereby enabling designers to enhance the user experience of interactive applications. In this article, we introduce Evolving Agents, a novel agent architecture that consists of two systems: Personality and Behavior. The Personality system includes Cognition, Emotion, and Character Growth modules. The Behavior system comprises two modules: Planning and Action. We also build a simulation platform that enables agents to interact with the environment and other agents. Evolving Agents can simulate the human personality evolution process. Compared to its initial state, agents' personality and behavior patterns undergo believable development after several days of simulation. Agents reflect on their behavior to reason and develop new personality traits. These traits, in turn, generate new behavior patterns, forming a feedback loop-like personality evolution. Our experiment utilized a simulation platform with ten agents for evaluation. During the assessment, these agents experienced believable and inspirational personality evolution. Through ablation and control experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of agent personality evolution, and all of our agent architecture modules contribute to creating believable human-like agents with diverse and dynamic personalities. We also demonstrated through workshops how Evolving Agents could inspire designers.

TITLE: A Systematic Approach to Artificial Agents
AUTHORS: Mark Burgin, Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Agents and agent systems are becoming more and more important in the development of a variety of fields such as ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, autonomous computing, intelligent systems and intelligent robotics. The need for improvement of our basic knowledge on agents is very essential. We take a systematic approach and present extended classification of artificial agents which can be useful for understanding of what artificial agents are and what they can be in the future. The aim of this classification is to give us insights in what kind of agents can be created and what type of problems demand a specific kind of agents for their solution.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

TITLE: Learning Latent Representations to Influence Multi-Agent Interaction
AUTHORS: Annie Xie, Dylan P. Losey, Ryan Tolsma, Chelsea Finn, Dorsa Sadigh
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Seamlessly interacting with humans or robots is hard because these agents are non-stationary. They update their policy in response to the ego agent's behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent.

TITLE: Corrigibility with Utility Preservation
AUTHORS: Koen Holtman
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Corrigibility is a safety property for artificially intelligent agents. A corrigible agent will not resist attempts by authorized parties to alter the goals and constraints that were encoded in the agent when it was first started. This paper shows how to construct a safety layer that adds corrigibility to arbitrarily advanced utility maximizing agents, including possible future agents with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The layer counter-acts the emergent incentive of advanced agents to resist such alteration. A detailed model for agents which can reason about preserving their utility function is developed, and used to prove that the corrigibility layer works as intended in a large set of non-hostile universes. The corrigible agents have an emergent incentive to protect key elements of their corrigibility layer. However, hostile universes may contain forces strong enough to break safety features. Some open problems related to graceful degradation when an agent is successfully attacked are identified. The results in this paper were obtained by concurrently developing an AGI agent simulator, an agent model, and proofs. The simulator is available under an open source license. The paper contains simulation results which illustrate the safety related properties of corrigible AGI agents in detail.

TITLE: A Systematic Approach to Artificial Agents
AUTHORS: Mark Burgin, Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Agents and agent systems are becoming more and more important in the development of a variety of fields such as ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, autonomous computing, intelligent systems and intelligent robotics. The need for improvement of our basic knowledge on agents is very essential. We take a systematic approach and present extended classification of artificial agents which can be useful for understanding of what artificial agents are and what they can be in the future. The aim of this classification is to give us insights in what kind of agents can be created and what type of problems demand a specific kind of agents for their solution.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

TITLE: Engineering Cooperative JADE Agents with the AMCIS Methodology: The
  Transportation Management Case Study
AUTHORS: Djamel Benmerzoug, Salim Djaaboub, Hani Mahmoudi
ABSTRACT: Abstract: This paper discusses in detail important analysis and design issues emerged during the development of an agent-based transportation e-market. This discussion is based on concepts coming from the AMCIS methodology and the JADE framework. The AMCIS methodology is specifically tailored to the analysis and design of cooperative information agent-based systems, while it supports both the levels of the individual agent structure and the agent society in the Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) development process. According to AMCIS, MAS are viewed as being composed of a number of autonomous cooperative agents that live in an organized society, in which each agent plays one or more specific roles, while their plans and interaction protocols are well defined. On the other hand JADE is a FIPA specifications compliant agent development environment that gives several facilities for an easy and fast implementation. Our aim is to reveal the mapping that may exists between the basic concepts proposed by AMCIS for agents specification and agents interactions and those provided by JADE for agents implementation, and therefore to propose a kind of roadmap for agents developers.

TITLE: Agents of Change: Self-Evolving LLM Agents for Strategic Planning
AUTHORS: Nikolas Belle, Dakota Barnes, Alfonso Amayuelas, Ivan Bercovich, Xin Eric Wang, William Wang
ABSTRACT: Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Autonomous agents represent an inevitable evolution of the internet. Current agent frameworks do not embed a standard protocol for agent-to-agent interaction, leaving existing agents isolated from their peers. As intellectual property is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents, a true agent economy requires equipping agents with a universal framework for engaging in binding contracts with each other, including the exchange of valuable training data, personality, and other forms of Intellectual Property. A purely agent-to-agent transaction layer would transcend the need for human intermediation in multi-agent interactions. The Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) introduces a trustless framework for exchanging IP between agents via programmable contracts, enabling agents to initiate, trade, borrow, and sell agent-to-agent contracts on the Story blockchain network. These contracts not only represent auditable onchain execution but also contain a legal wrapper that allows agents to express and enforce their actions in the offchain legal setting, creating legal personhood for agents. Via ATCP/IP, agents can autonomously sell their training data to other agents, license confidential or proprietary information, collaborate on content based on their unique skills, all of which constitutes an emergent knowledge economy.

Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important research issue. In many multi-agent systems, the interactions between agents often happen locally, which means that agents neither need to coordinate with all other agents nor need to coordinate with others all the time. Traditional methods attempt to use pre-defined rules to capture the interaction relationship between agents. However, the methods cannot be directly used in a large-scale environment due to the difficulty of transforming the complex interactions between agents into rules. In this paper, we model the relationship between agents by a complete graph and propose a novel game abstraction mechanism based on two-stage attention network (G2ANet), which can indicate whether there is an interaction between two agents and the importance of the interaction. We integrate this detection mechanism into graph neural network-based multi-agent reinforcement learning for conducting game abstraction and propose two novel learning algorithms GA-Comm and GA-AC.

Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable, and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent multimodal reasoning.

ABSTRACT: Title: Algorithms in Multi-Agent Systems: A Holistic Perspective from
  Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory
 Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved outstanding results in recent years, which has led a dramatic increase in the number of methods and applications. Recent works are exploring learning beyond single-agent scenarios and considering multi-agent scenarios. However, they are faced with lots of challenges and are seeking for help from traditional game-theoretic algorithms, which, in turn, show bright application promise combined with modern algorithms and boosting computing power. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts and algorithms in single agent RL and multi-agent systems; then, we summarize the related algorithms from three aspects. Solution concepts from game theory give inspiration to algorithms which try to evaluate the agents or find better solutions in multi-agent systems. Fictitious self-play becomes popular and has a great impact on the algorithm of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Counterfactual regret minimization is an important tool to solve games with incomplete information, and has shown great strength when combined with deep learning.

ABSTRACT: Title: Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search for Partially Observable
  Multi-agent Pathfinding
 Abstract: The Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem involves finding a set of conflict-free paths for a group of agents confined to a graph. In typical MAPF scenarios, the graph and the agents' starting and ending vertices are known beforehand, allowing the use of centralized planning algorithms. However, in this study, we focus on the decentralized MAPF setting, where the agents may observe the other agents only locally and are restricted in communications with each other. Specifically, we investigate the lifelong variant of MAPF, where new goals are continually assigned to the agents upon completion of previous ones. Drawing inspiration from the successful AlphaZero approach, we propose a decentralized multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method for MAPF tasks. Our approach utilizes the agent's observations to recreate the intrinsic Markov decision process, which is then used for planning with a tailored for multi-agent tasks version of neural MCTS. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learnable MAPF solvers. The source code is available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/mats-lp.

TITLE: Sequential Information Elicitation in Multi-Agent Systems
AUTHORS: Rann Smorodinsky, Moshe Tennenholtz
ABSTRACT: Title: Sequential Information Elicitation in Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: We introduce the study of sequential information elicitation in strategic multi-agent systems. In an information elicitation setup a center attempts to compute the value of a function based on private information (a-k-a secrets) accessible to a set of agents. We consider the classical multi-party computation setup where each agent is interested in knowing the result of the function. However, in our setting each agent is strategic,and since acquiring information is costly, an agent may be tempted not spending the efforts of obtaining the information, free-riding on other agents' computations. A mechanism which elicits agents' secrets and performs the desired computation defines a game. A mechanism is 'appropriate' if there exists an equilibrium in which it is able to elicit (sufficiently many) agents' secrets and perform the computation, for all possible secret vectors.We characterize a general efficient procedure for determining an appropriate mechanism, if such mechanism exists. Moreover, we also address the existence problem, providing a polynomial algorithm for verifying the existence of an appropriate mechanism.

Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment.

However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors.

This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations.

Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions.

TITLE: Large Language Models are Autonomous Cyber Defenders
AUTHORS: Sebastián R. Castro, Roberto Campbell, Nancy Lau, Octavio Villalobos, Jiaqi Duan, Alvaro A. Cardenas
ABSTRACT: Title: Large Language Models are Autonomous Cyber Defenders
 Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

ABSTRACT: Title: PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack,
  Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.

AUTHORS: Shaina Raza, Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee, Christos Emmanouilidis
ABSTRACT: Title: TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management
  in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

TITLE: PeerGuard: Defending Multi-Agent Systems Against Backdoor Attacks
  Through Mutual Reasoning
AUTHORS: Falong Fan, Xi Li
ABSTRACT: Title: PeerGuard: Defending Multi-Agent Systems Against Backdoor Attacks
  Through Mutual Reasoning
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.

TITLE: Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Multi-Tool
  Empowered LLM Agents
AUTHORS: Zichuan Li, Jian Cui, Xiaojing Liao, Luyi Xing
ABSTRACT: Title: Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Multi-Tool
  Empowered LLM Agents
 Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of reasoning and planning to solve problems by leveraging a set of tools. However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 66 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 75\% are vulnerable to XTHP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.

TITLE: MAEBE: Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Framework
AUTHORS: Sinem Erisken, Timothy Gothard, Martin Leitgab, Ram Potham
ABSTRACT: Title: MAEBE: Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Framework
 Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

ABSTRACT: Title: LLM-Agent-Controller: A Universal Multi-Agent Large Language Model
  System as a Control Engineer
 Abstract: This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents, supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to various technical domains.

ABSTRACT: Title: Adversarial Attacks on Cooperative Multi-agent Bandits
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (CMA2B) consider the collaborative efforts of multiple agents in a shared multi-armed bandit game. We study latent vulnerabilities exposed by this collaboration and consider adversarial attacks on a few agents with the goal of influencing the decisions of the rest. More specifically, we study adversarial attacks on CMA2B in both homogeneous settings, where agents operate with the same arm set, and heterogeneous settings, where agents have distinct arm sets. In the homogeneous setting, we propose attack strategies that, by targeting just one agent, convince all agents to select a particular target arm $T-o(T)$ times while incurring $o(T)$ attack costs in $T$ rounds. In the heterogeneous setting, we prove that a target arm attack requires linear attack costs and propose attack strategies that can force a maximum number of agents to suffer linear regrets while incurring sublinear costs and only manipulating the observations of a few target agents. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed attack strategies.

TITLE: Directionality Reinforcement Learning to Operate Multi-Agent System
  without Communication
AUTHORS: Fumito Uwano, Keiki Takadama
ABSTRACT: Title: Directionality Reinforcement Learning to Operate Multi-Agent System
  without Communication
 Abstract: This paper establishes directionality reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to propose the complete decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning method which can achieve cooperation based on each agent's learning: no communication and no observation. Concretely, DRL adds the direction "agents have to learn to reach the farthest goal among reachable ones" to learning agents to operate the agents cooperatively. Furthermore, to investigate the effectiveness of the DRL, this paper compare Q-learning agent with DRL with previous learning agent in maze problems. Experimental results derive that (1) DRL performs better than the previous method in terms of the spending time, (2) the direction makes agents learn yielding action for others, and (3) DRL suggests achieving multiagent learning with few costs for any number of agents.

TITLE: Prosocial learning agents solve generalized Stag Hunts better than
  selfish ones
AUTHORS: Alexander Peysakhovich, Adam Lerer
ABSTRACT: Title: Prosocial learning agents solve generalized Stag Hunts better than
  selfish ones
 Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has become an important paradigm for constructing agents that can enter complex multi-agent situations and improve their policies through experience. One commonly used technique is reactive training - applying standard RL methods while treating other agents as a part of the learner's environment. It is known that in general-sum games reactive training can lead groups of agents to converge to inefficient outcomes. We focus on one such class of environments: Stag Hunt games. Here agents either choose a risky cooperative policy (which leads to high payoffs if both choose it but low payoffs to an agent who attempts it alone) or a safe one (which leads to a safe payoff no matter what). We ask how we can change the learning rule of a single agent to improve its outcomes in Stag Hunts that include other reactive learners. We extend existing work on reward-shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning and show that that making a single agent prosocial, that is, making them care about the rewards of their partners can increase the probability that groups converge to good outcomes. Thus, even if we control a single agent in a group making that agent prosocial can increase our agent's long-run payoff. We show experimentally that this result carries over to a variety of more complex environments with Stag Hunt-like dynamics including ones where agents must learn from raw input pixels.

TITLE: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolution
  Communication
AUTHORS: Jianyu Su, Stephen Adams, Peter A. Beling
ABSTRACT: Title: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolution
  Communication
 Abstract: We consider a fully cooperative multi-agent system where agents cooperate to maximize a system's utility in a partial-observable environment. We propose that multi-agent systems must have the ability to (1) communicate and understand the inter-plays between agents and (2) correctly distribute rewards based on an individual agent's contribution. In contrast, most work in this setting considers only one of the above abilities. In this study, we develop an architecture that allows for communication among agents and tailors the system's reward for each individual agent. Our architecture represents agent communication through graph convolution and applies an existing credit assignment structure, counterfactual multi-agent policy gradient (COMA), to assist agents to learn communication by back-propagation. The flexibility of the graph structure enables our method to be applicable to a variety of multi-agent systems, e.g. dynamic systems that consist of varying numbers of agents and static systems with a fixed number of agents. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating the advantage of marrying communication with credit assignment. In the experiments, our proposed method yields better performance than the state-of-art methods, including COMA. Moreover, we show that the communication strategies offers us insights and interpretability of the system's cooperative policies.

TITLE: Fair Division of Multi-layered Cakes
AUTHORS: Mohammad Azharuddin Sanpui
ABSTRACT: Title: Fair Division of Multi-layered Cakes
 Abstract: We consider multi-layered cake cutting in order to fairly allocate numerous divisible resources (layers of cake) among a group of agents under two constraints: contiguity and feasibility. We first introduce a new computational model in a multi-layered cake named ``a pair of knives''. Then, we show the existence of an exact multi-allocation for two agents and two layers using the new computational model. We demonstrate the computation procedure of a feasible and contiguous proportional multi-allocation over a three-layered cake for more than three agents. Finally, we develop a technique for computing proportional allocations for any number $n\geq 2^a3$ of agents and $2^a3$ layers, where $a$ is any positive integer.

AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

AUTHORS: Haobin Jiang, Ziluo Ding, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty
  Sharing
 Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.

TITLE: Sequential Information Elicitation in Multi-Agent Systems
AUTHORS: Rann Smorodinsky, Moshe Tennenholtz
ABSTRACT: Title: Sequential Information Elicitation in Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: We introduce the study of sequential information elicitation in strategic multi-agent systems. In an information elicitation setup a center attempts to compute the value of a function based on private information (a-k-a secrets) accessible to a set of agents. We consider the classical multi-party computation setup where each agent is interested in knowing the result of the function. However, in our setting each agent is strategic,and since acquiring information is costly, an agent may be tempted not spending the efforts of obtaining the information, free-riding on other agents' computations. A mechanism which elicits agents' secrets and performs the desired computation defines a game. A mechanism is 'appropriate' if there exists an equilibrium in which it is able to elicit (sufficiently many) agents' secrets and perform the computation, for all possible secret vectors.We characterize a general efficient procedure for determining an appropriate mechanism, if such mechanism exists. Moreover, we also address the existence problem, providing a polynomial algorithm for verifying the existence of an appropriate mechanism.

TITLE: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Zeyuan Liu, Zhirui Fang, Kefan Su, Liwen Zhu, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
 Abstract: The partial observability and stochasticity in multi-agent settings can be mitigated by accessing more information about others via communication. However, the coordination problem still exists since agents cannot communicate actual actions with each other at the same time due to the circular dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level communication scheme, Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two communication phases. In the negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing the value of intention, obtained by modeling the environment dynamics. In the launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions and then communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.

TITLE: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
AUTHORS: Maude J. Blondin, Matthew Hale
ABSTRACT: Title: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
 Abstract: Multi-agent optimization problems with many objective functions have drawn much interest over the past two decades. Many works on the subject minimize the sum of objective functions, which implicitly carries a decision about the problem formulation. Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted sum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network. Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice of weights impacts the agents' final result.

ABSTRACT: Title: An Approach to Model Checking of Multi-agent Data Analysis
 Abstract: The paper presents an approach to verification of a multi-agent data analysis algorithm. We base correct simulation of the multi-agent system by a finite integer model. For verification we use model checking tool SPIN. Protocols of agents are written in Promela language and properties of the multi-agent data analysis system are expressed in logic LTL. We run several experiments with SPIN and the model.

TITLE: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
AUTHORS: Yifeng Ding, Wesley H. Holliday, Cedegao Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
 Abstract: The early literature on epistemic logic in philosophy focused on reasoning about the knowledge or belief of a single agent, especially on controversies about "introspection axioms" such as the 4 and 5 axioms. By contrast, the later literature on epistemic logic in computer science and game theory has focused on multi-agent epistemic reasoning, with the single-agent 4 and 5 axioms largely taken for granted. In the relevant multi-agent scenarios, it is often important to reason about what agent A believes about what agent B believes about what agent A believes; but it is rarely important to reason just about what agent A believes about what agent A believes. This raises the question of the extent to which single-agent introspection axioms actually matter for multi-agent epistemic reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and answer this question. To formalize the question, we first define a set of multi-agent formulas that we call agent-alternating formulas, including formulas like Box_a Box_b Box_a p but not formulas like Box_a Box_a p. We then prove, for the case of belief, that if one starts with multi-agent K or KD, then adding both the 4 and 5 axioms (or adding the B axiom) does not allow the derivation of any new agent-alternating formulas -- in this sense, introspection axioms do not matter. By contrast, we show that such conservativity results fail for knowledge and multi-agent KT, though they hold with respect to a smaller class of agent-nonrepeating formulas.

TITLE: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
 Abstract: Communication lays the foundation for human cooperation. It is also crucial for multi-agent cooperation. However, existing work focuses on broadcast communication, which is not only impractical but also leads to information redundancy that could even impair the learning process. To tackle these difficulties, we propose Individually Inferred Communication (I2C), a simple yet effective model to enable agents to learn a prior for agent-agent communication. The prior knowledge is learned via causal inference and realized by a feed-forward neural network that maps the agent's local observation to a belief about who to communicate with. The influence of one agent on another is inferred via the joint action-value function in multi-agent reinforcement learning and quantified to label the necessity of agent-agent communication. Furthermore, the agent policy is regularized to better exploit communicated messages. Empirically, we show that I2C can not only reduce communication overhead but also improve the performance in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios, comparing to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-AI-Edge/I2C.

TITLE: Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for
  Multi-Agent Intelligence
AUTHORS: Yuhang Song, Andrzej Wojcicki, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Jianyi Wang, Abi Aryan, Zhenghua Xu, Mai Xu, Zihan Ding, Lianlong Wu
ABSTRACT: Title: Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for
  Multi-Agent Intelligence
 Abstract: Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests, but also innovating is becoming a hot topic in AI. One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for others. However, existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logics and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided game set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic multi-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide Python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance. As such, the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard. All the implementations and accompanied tutorials have been open-sourced for the community at https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/.

TITLE: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

TITLE: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Zeyuan Liu, Zhirui Fang, Kefan Su, Liwen Zhu, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
 Abstract: The partial observability and stochasticity in multi-agent settings can be mitigated by accessing more information about others via communication. However, the coordination problem still exists since agents cannot communicate actual actions with each other at the same time due to the circular dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level communication scheme, Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two communication phases. In the negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing the value of intention, obtained by modeling the environment dynamics. In the launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions and then communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.

TITLE: Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty
  Sharing
AUTHORS: Haobin Jiang, Ziluo Ding, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty
  Sharing
 Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.

TITLE: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
 Abstract: Communication lays the foundation for human cooperation. It is also crucial for multi-agent cooperation. However, existing work focuses on broadcast communication, which is not only impractical but also leads to information redundancy that could even impair the learning process. To tackle these difficulties, we propose Individually Inferred Communication (I2C), a simple yet effective model to enable agents to learn a prior for agent-agent communication. The prior knowledge is learned via causal inference and realized by a feed-forward neural network that maps the agent's local observation to a belief about who to communicate with. The influence of one agent on another is inferred via the joint action-value function in multi-agent reinforcement learning and quantified to label the necessity of agent-agent communication. Furthermore, the agent policy is regularized to better exploit communicated messages. Empirically, we show that I2C can not only reduce communication overhead but also improve the performance in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios, comparing to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-AI-Edge/I2C.

TITLE: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
AUTHORS: Yifeng Ding, Wesley H. Holliday, Cedegao Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
 Abstract: The early literature on epistemic logic in philosophy focused on reasoning about the knowledge or belief of a single agent, especially on controversies about "introspection axioms" such as the 4 and 5 axioms. By contrast, the later literature on epistemic logic in computer science and game theory has focused on multi-agent epistemic reasoning, with the single-agent 4 and 5 axioms largely taken for granted. In the relevant multi-agent scenarios, it is often important to reason about what agent A believes about what agent B believes about what agent A believes; but it is rarely important to reason just about what agent A believes about what agent A believes. This raises the question of the extent to which single-agent introspection axioms actually matter for multi-agent epistemic reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and answer this question. To formalize the question, we first define a set of multi-agent formulas that we call agent-alternating formulas, including formulas like Box_a Box_b Box_a p but not formulas like Box_a Box_a p. We then prove, for the case of belief, that if one starts with multi-agent K or KD, then adding both the 4 and 5 axioms (or adding the B axiom) does not allow the derivation of any new agent-alternating formulas -- in this sense, introspection axioms do not matter. By contrast, we show that such conservativity results fail for knowledge and multi-agent KT, though they hold with respect to a smaller class of agent-nonrepeating formulas.

TITLE: Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for
  Multi-Agent Intelligence
AUTHORS: Yuhang Song, Andrzej Wojcicki, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Jianyi Wang, Abi Aryan, Zhenghua Xu, Mai Xu, Zihan Ding, Lianlong Wu
ABSTRACT: Title: Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for
  Multi-Agent Intelligence
 Abstract: Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests, but also innovating is becoming a hot topic in AI. One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for others. However, existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logics and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided game set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic multi-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide Python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance. As such, the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard. All the implementations and accompanied tutorials have been open-sourced for the community at https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/.

TITLE: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

TITLE: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Zeyuan Liu, Zhirui Fang, Kefan Su, Liwen Zhu, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
 Abstract: The partial observability and stochasticity in multi-agent settings can be mitigated by accessing more information about others via communication. However, the coordination problem still exists since agents cannot communicate actual actions with each other at the same time due to the circular dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level communication scheme, Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two communication phases. In the negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing the value of intention, obtained by modeling the environment dynamics. In the launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions and then communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.

TITLE: Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty
  Sharing
AUTHORS: Haobin Jiang, Ziluo Ding, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Settling Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration by Novelty
  Sharing
 Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.

TITLE: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
AUTHORS: Yifeng Ding, Wesley H. Holliday, Cedegao Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: When Do Introspection Axioms Matter for Multi-Agent Epistemic Reasoning?
 Abstract: The early literature on epistemic logic in philosophy focused on reasoning about the knowledge or belief of a single agent, especially on controversies about "introspection axioms" such as the 4 and 5 axioms. By contrast, the later literature on epistemic logic in computer science and game theory has focused on multi-agent epistemic reasoning, with the single-agent 4 and 5 axioms largely taken for granted. In the relevant multi-agent scenarios, it is often important to reason about what agent A believes about what agent B believes about what agent A believes; but it is rarely important to reason just about what agent A believes about what agent A believes. This raises the question of the extent to which single-agent introspection axioms actually matter for multi-agent epistemic reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and answer this question. To formalize the question, we first define a set of multi-agent formulas that we call agent-alternating formulas, including formulas like Box_a Box_b Box_a p but not formulas like Box_a Box_a p. We then prove, for the case of belief, that if one starts with multi-agent K or KD, then adding both the 4 and 5 axioms (or adding the B axiom) does not allow the derivation of any new agent-alternating formulas -- in this sense, introspection axioms do not matter. By contrast, we show that such conservativity results fail for knowledge and multi-agent KT, though they hold with respect to a smaller class of agent-nonrepeating formulas.

TITLE: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Learning Individually Inferred Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation
 Abstract: Communication lays the foundation for human cooperation. It is also crucial for multi-agent cooperation. However, existing work focuses on broadcast communication, which is not only impractical but also leads to information redundancy that could even impair the learning process. To tackle these difficulties, we propose Individually Inferred Communication (I2C), a simple yet effective model to enable agents to learn a prior for agent-agent communication. The prior knowledge is learned via causal inference and realized by a feed-forward neural network that maps the agent's local observation to a belief about who to communicate with. The influence of one agent on another is inferred via the joint action-value function in multi-agent reinforcement learning and quantified to label the necessity of agent-agent communication. Furthermore, the agent policy is regularized to better exploit communicated messages. Empirically, we show that I2C can not only reduce communication overhead but also improve the performance in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios, comparing to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-AI-Edge/I2C.

TITLE: Consensus of switched multi-agent systems
AUTHORS: Yuanshi Zheng, Jingying Ma, Long Wang
ABSTRACT: Title: Consensus of switched multi-agent systems
 Abstract: In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of switched multi-agent system composed of continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems. By combining the classical consensus protocols of continuous-time and discrete-time multi-agent systems, we propose a linear consensus protocol for switched multi-agent system. Based on the graph theory and Lyapunov theory, we prove that the consensus of switched multi-agent system is solvable under arbitrary switching with undirected connected graph, directed graph and switching topologies, respectively. Simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

TITLE: Consensus of Hybrid Multi-agent Systems
AUTHORS: Yuanshi Zheng, Jingying Ma, Long Wang
ABSTRACT: Title: Consensus of Hybrid Multi-agent Systems
 Abstract: In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of hybrid multi-agent system. First, the hybrid multi-agent system is proposed which is composed of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents. Then, three kinds of consensus protocols are presented for hybrid multi-agent system. The analysis tool developed in this paper is based on the matrix theory and graph theory. With different restrictions of the sampling period, some necessary and sufficient conditions are established for solving the consensus of hybrid multi-agent system. The consensus states are also obtained under different protocols. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

TITLE: Delta-operator based consensus analysis of multi-agent networks with
  link failures
AUTHORS: Xue Lin, Yuanshi Zheng, Long Wang
ABSTRACT: Title: Delta-operator based consensus analysis of multi-agent networks with
  link failures
 Abstract: In this paper, a discrete-time multi-agent system is presented which is formulated in terms of the delta operator. The proposed multi-agent system can unify discrete-time and continuous-time multi-agent systems. In a multi-agent network, in practice, the communication among agents is acted upon by various factors. The communication network among faulty agents may cause link failures, which is modeled by randomly switching graphs. First, we show that the delta representation of discrete-time multi-agent system reaches consensus in mean (in probability and almost surely) if the expected graph is strongly connected. The results induce that the continuous-time multi-agent system with random networks can also reach consensus in the same sense. Second, the influence of faulty agents on consensus value is quantified under original network. By using matrix perturbation theory, the error bound is also presented in this paper. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

TITLE: Resilient Leader-Follower Consensus to Arbitrary Reference Values
AUTHORS: James Usevitch, Dimitra Panagou
ABSTRACT: Title: Resilient Leader-Follower Consensus to Arbitrary Reference Values
 Abstract: The problem of consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents has increasingly attracted attention in the literature. Prior results have established algorithms and graph structures for multi-agent networks which guarantee the consensus of normally behaving agents in the presence of a bounded number of misbehaving agents. The final consensus value is guaranteed to fall within the convex hull of initial agent states. However, the problem of consensus tracking considers consensus to arbitrary reference values which may not lie within such bounds. Conditions for consensus tracking in the presence of misbehaving agents has not been fully studied. This paper presents conditions for a network of agents using the W-MSR algorithm to achieve this objective.

TITLE: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Wesley Suttle, Zhuoran Yang, Kaiqing Zhang, Zhaoran Wang, Tamer Basar, Ji Liu
ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: This paper extends off-policy reinforcement learning to the multi-agent case in which a set of networked agents communicating with their neighbors according to a time-varying graph collaboratively evaluates and improves a target policy while following a distinct behavior policy. To this end, the paper develops a multi-agent version of emphatic temporal difference learning for off-policy policy evaluation, and proves convergence under linear function approximation. The paper then leverages this result, in conjunction with a novel multi-agent off-policy policy gradient theorem and recent work in both multi-agent on-policy and single-agent off-policy actor-critic methods, to develop and give convergence guarantees for a new multi-agent off-policy actor-critic algorithm.

ABSTRACT: Title: Local Optimization Achieves Global Optimality in Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Policy optimization methods with function approximation are widely used in multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, it remains elusive how to design such algorithms with statistical guarantees. Leveraging a multi-agent performance difference lemma that characterizes the landscape of multi-agent policy optimization, we find that the localized action value function serves as an ideal descent direction for each local policy. Motivated by the observation, we present a multi-agent PPO algorithm in which the local policy of each agent is updated similarly to vanilla PPO. We prove that with standard regularity conditions on the Markov game and problem-dependent quantities, our algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. We extend our algorithm to the off-policy setting and introduce pessimism to policy evaluation, which aligns with experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first provably convergent multi-agent PPO algorithm in cooperative Markov games.

TITLE: Local Optimization Achieves Global Optimality in Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Yulai Zhao, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang, Jason D. Lee
ABSTRACT: Title: Local Optimization Achieves Global Optimality in Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Policy optimization methods with function approximation are widely used in multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, it remains elusive how to design such algorithms with statistical guarantees. Leveraging a multi-agent performance difference lemma that characterizes the landscape of multi-agent policy optimization, we find that the localized action value function serves as an ideal descent direction for each local policy. Motivated by the observation, we present a multi-agent PPO algorithm in which the local policy of each agent is updated similarly to vanilla PPO. We prove that with standard regularity conditions on the Markov game and problem-dependent quantities, our algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. We extend our algorithm to the off-policy setting and introduce pessimism to policy evaluation, which aligns with experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first provably convergent multi-agent PPO algorithm in cooperative Markov games.

ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: This paper extends off-policy reinforcement learning to the multi-agent case in which a set of networked agents communicating with their neighbors according to a time-varying graph collaboratively evaluates and improves a target policy while following a distinct behavior policy. To this end, the paper develops a multi-agent version of emphatic temporal difference learning for off-policy policy evaluation, and proves convergence under linear function approximation. The paper then leverages this result, in conjunction with a novel multi-agent off-policy policy gradient theorem and recent work in both multi-agent on-policy and single-agent off-policy actor-critic methods, to develop and give convergence guarantees for a new multi-agent off-policy actor-critic algorithm.

TITLE: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolution
  Communication
AUTHORS: Jianyu Su, Stephen Adams, Peter A. Beling
ABSTRACT: Title: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolution
  Communication
 Abstract: We consider a fully cooperative multi-agent system where agents cooperate to maximize a system's utility in a partial-observable environment. We propose that multi-agent systems must have the ability to (1) communicate and understand the inter-plays between agents and (2) correctly distribute rewards based on an individual agent's contribution. In contrast, most work in this setting considers only one of the above abilities. In this study, we develop an architecture that allows for communication among agents and tailors the system's reward for each individual agent. Our architecture represents agent communication through graph convolution and applies an existing credit assignment structure, counterfactual multi-agent policy gradient (COMA), to assist agents to learn communication by back-propagation. The flexibility of the graph structure enables our method to be applicable to a variety of multi-agent systems, e.g. dynamic systems that consist of varying numbers of agents and static systems with a fixed number of agents. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating the advantage of marrying communication with credit assignment. In the experiments, our proposed method yields better performance than the state-of-art methods, including COMA. Moreover, we show that the communication strategies offers us insights and interpretability of the system's cooperative policies.

TITLE: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
AUTHORS: Soheil Mohseni, Seyed Masoud Moghaddas-Tafreshi
ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

ABSTRACT: Title: Development of a Multi-Agent System for Optimal Sizing of a Commercial
  Complex Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on a multi-agent system (MAS) is applied to the problem of optimal sizing in a stand-alone office complex microgrid such that the electricity demand of the office building and the charging demand of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging station are met. The proposed MAS-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical load agent (LA), PHEV charging station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. In the proposed MAS, control agent coordinates the interactions between the generation agent and electrical load and charging station agents and following a request from design agent, sends the information on the operation of the microgrid with determined sizes to the design agent. According to the received information, design agent finds the optimal sizes of the system's components such that the electricity and charging demands are met considering two reliability indices to investment decisions. This study is performed for Kish Island in south Iran.

TITLE: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Complex Engineering Problem-Solving: A
  Framework for Senior Design Projects
AUTHORS: Abdullah Mushtaq, Muhammad Rafay Naeem, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Muhammad Imran Taj, Imran Hashmi, Junaid Qadir
ABSTRACT: Title: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Complex Engineering Problem-Solving: A
  Framework for Senior Design Projects
 Abstract: Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of...

TITLE: Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization With Linear Function
  Approximations
AUTHORS: Prashant Trivedi, Nandyala Hemachandra
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization With Linear Function
  Approximations
 Abstract: This work considers multiple agents traversing a network from a source node to the goal node. The cost to an agent for traveling a link has a private as well as a congestion component. The agent's objective is to find a path to the goal node with minimum overall cost in a decentralized way. We model this as a fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and propose a novel multi-agent congestion cost minimization (MACCM) algorithm. Our MACCM algorithm uses linear function approximations of transition probabilities and the global cost function. In the absence of a central controller and to preserve privacy, agents communicate the cost function parameters to their neighbors via a time-varying communication network. Moreover, each agent maintains its estimate of the global state-action value, which is updated via a multi-agent extended value iteration (MAEVI) sub-routine. We show that our MACCM algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret. The proof requires the convergence of cost function parameters, the MAEVI algorithm, and analysis of the regret bounds induced by the MAEVI triggering condition for each agent. We implement our algorithm on a two node network with multiple links to validate it. We first identify the optimal policy, the optimal number of agents going to the goal node in each period. We observe that the average regret is close to zero for 2 and 3 agents. The optimal policy captures the trade-off between the minimum cost of staying at a node and the congestion cost of going to the goal node. Our work is a generalization of learning the stochastic shortest path problem.

TITLE: Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization With Linear Function
  Approximations
AUTHORS: Prashant Trivedi, Nandyala Hemachandra
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization With Linear Function
  Approximations
 Abstract: This work considers multiple agents traversing a network from a source node to the goal node. The cost to an agent for traveling a link has a private as well as a congestion component. The agent's objective is to find a path to the goal node with minimum overall cost in a decentralized way. We model this as a fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and propose a novel multi-agent congestion cost minimization (MACCM) algorithm. Our MACCM algorithm uses linear function approximations of transition probabilities and the global cost function. In the absence of a central controller and to preserve privacy, agents communicate the cost function parameters to their neighbors via a time-varying communication network. Moreover, each agent maintains its estimate of the global state-action value, which is updated via a multi-agent extended value iteration (MAEVI) sub-routine. We show that our MACCM algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret. The proof requires the convergence of cost function parameters, the MAEVI algorithm, and analysis of the regret bounds induced by the MAEVI triggering condition for each agent. We implement our algorithm on a two node network with multiple links to validate it. We first identify the optimal policy, the optimal number of agents going to the goal node in each period. We observe that the average regret is close to zero for 2 and 3 agents. The optimal policy captures the trade-off between the minimum cost of staying at a node and the congestion cost of going to the goal node. Our work is a generalization of learning the stochastic shortest path problem.

TITLE: Mean Field Behaviour of Collaborative Multi-Agent Foragers
AUTHORS: Daniel Jarne Ornia, Pedro J Zufiria, Manuel Mazo Jr
ABSTRACT: Title: Mean Field Behaviour of Collaborative Multi-Agent Foragers
 Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent robotic systems where agents coordinate by modifying a shared environment often result in undesired dynamical couplings that complicate the analysis and experiments when solving a specific problem or task. Simultaneously, biologically-inspired robotics rely on simplifying agents and increasing their number to obtain more efficient solutions to such problems, drawing similarities with natural processes. In this work we focus on the problem of a biologically-inspired multi-agent system solving collaborative foraging. We show how mean field techniques can be used to re-formulate such a stochastic multi-agent problem into a deterministic autonomous system. This de-couples agent dynamics, enabling the computation of limit behaviours and the analysis of optimality guarantees. Furthermore, we analyse how having finite number of agents affects the performance when compared to the mean field limit and we discuss the implications of such limit approximations in this multi-agent system, which have impact on more general collaborative stochastic problems.

TITLE: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
AUTHORS: Arne Tillmann
ABSTRACT: Title: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
 Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Transient Diversity in Multi-Agent Systems
AUTHORS: David Lyback
ABSTRACT: Title: Transient Diversity in Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Diversity is an important aspect of highly efficient multi-agent teams. We introduce the main factors that drive a multi-agent system in either direction along the diversity scale. A metric for diversity is described, and we speculate on the concept of transient diversity. Finally, an experiment on social entropy using a RoboCup simulated soccer team is presented.

TITLE: Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
AUTHORS: Matthias Gerstgrasser, Tom Danino, Sarah Keren
ABSTRACT: Title: Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We present a novel multi-agent RL approach, Selective Multi-Agent Prioritized Experience Relay, in which agents share with other agents a limited number of transitions they observe during training. The intuition behind this is that even a small number of relevant experiences from other agents could help each agent learn. Unlike many other multi-agent RL algorithms, this approach allows for largely decentralized training, requiring only a limited communication channel between agents. We show that our approach outperforms baseline no-sharing decentralized training and state-of-the art multi-agent RL algorithms. Further, sharing only a small number of highly relevant experiences outperforms sharing all experiences between agents, and the performance uplift from selective experience sharing is robust across a range of hyperparameters and DQN variants. A reference implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/mgerstgrasser/super.

ABSTRACT: Title: An Agent-based Model for Competitive Agents
 Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the behavior of a multi-agent system driven by the interactions of agents within a competitive environment. To achieve this, we describe the transition probabilities that underlie the system's stochastic nature. We also derive the Fokker-Planck equations for the density distribution of the number of agents in the system and solve these equations for specific cases.

TITLE: Learning Individual Policies in Large Multi-agent Systems through Local
  Variance Minimization
AUTHORS: Tanvi Verma, Pradeep Varakantham
ABSTRACT: Title: Learning Individual Policies in Large Multi-agent Systems through Local
  Variance Minimization
 Abstract: In multi-agent systems with large number of agents, typically the contribution of each agent to the value of other agents is minimal (e.g., aggregation systems such as Uber, Deliveroo). In this paper, we consider such multi-agent systems where each agent is self-interested and takes a sequence of decisions and represent them as a Stochastic Non-atomic Congestion Game (SNCG). We derive key properties for equilibrium solutions in SNCG model with non-atomic and also nearly non-atomic agents. With those key equilibrium properties, we provide a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism that minimizes variance across values of agents in the same state. To demonstrate the utility of this new mechanism, we provide detailed results on a real-world taxi dataset and also a generic simulator for aggregation systems. We show that our approach reduces the variance in revenues earned by taxi drivers, while still providing higher joint revenues than leading approaches.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

ABSTRACT: Title: Engineering Cooperative JADE Agents with the AMCIS Methodology: The
  Transportation Management Case Study
 Abstract: This paper discusses in detail important analysis and design issues emerged during the development of an agent-based transportation e-market. This discussion is based on concepts coming from the AMCIS methodology and the JADE framework. The AMCIS methodology is specifically tailored to the analysis and design of cooperative information agent-based systems, while it supports both the levels of the individual agent structure and the agent society in the Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) development process. According to AMCIS, MAS are viewed as being composed of a number of autonomous cooperative agents that live in an organized society, in which each agent plays one or more specific roles, while their plans and interaction protocols are well defined. On the other hand JADE is a FIPA specifications compliant agent development environment that gives several facilities for an easy and fast implementation. Our aim is to reveal the mapping that may exists between the basic concepts proposed by AMCIS for agents specification and agents interactions and those provided by JADE for agents implementation, and therefore to propose a kind of roadmap for agents developers.

ABSTRACT: Title: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
 Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

TITLE: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
AUTHORS: Arne Tillmann
ABSTRACT: Title: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
 Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

ABSTRACT: Title: Engineering Cooperative JADE Agents with the AMCIS Methodology: The
  Transportation Management Case Study
 Abstract: This paper discusses in detail important analysis and design issues emerged during the development of an agent-based transportation e-market. This discussion is based on concepts coming from the AMCIS methodology and the JADE framework. The AMCIS methodology is specifically tailored to the analysis and design of cooperative information agent-based systems, while it supports both the levels of the individual agent structure and the agent society in the Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) development process. According to AMCIS, MAS are viewed as being composed of a number of autonomous cooperative agents that live in an organized society, in which each agent plays one or more specific roles, while their plans and interaction protocols are well defined. On the other hand JADE is a FIPA specifications compliant agent development environment that gives several facilities for an easy and fast implementation. Our aim is to reveal the mapping that may exists between the basic concepts proposed by AMCIS for agents specification and agents interactions and those provided by JADE for agents implementation, and therefore to propose a kind of roadmap for agents developers.

TITLE: Learning Latent Representations to Influence Multi-Agent Interaction
AUTHORS: Annie Xie, Dylan P. Losey, Ryan Tolsma, Chelsea Finn, Dorsa Sadigh
ABSTRACT: Title: Learning Latent Representations to Influence Multi-Agent Interaction
 Abstract: Seamlessly interacting with humans or robots is hard because these agents are non-stationary. They update their policy in response to the ego agent's behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent.

ABSTRACT: Title: The Athenian Academy: A Seven-Layer Architecture Model for Multi-Agent
  Systems
 Abstract: This paper proposes the "Academy of Athens" multi-agent seven-layer framework, aimed at systematically addressing challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism. The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration, single-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal, single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative applications in the art field.

TITLE: An Unified Intelligence-Communication Model for Multi-Agent System
  Part-I: Overview
AUTHORS: Bo Zhang, Bin Chen, Jinyu Yang, Wenjing Yang, Jiankang Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: An Unified Intelligence-Communication Model for Multi-Agent System
  Part-I: Overview
 Abstract: Motivated by Shannon's model and recent rehabilitation of self-supervised artificial intelligence having a "World Model", this paper propose an unified intelligence-communication (UIC) model for describing a single agent and any multi-agent system.   Firstly, the environment is modelled as the generic communication channel between agents. Secondly, the UIC model adopts a learning-agent model for unifying several well-adopted agent architecture, e.g. rule-based agent model in complex adaptive systems, layered model for describing human-level intelligence, world-model based agent model. The model may also provide an unified approach to investigate a multi-agent system (MAS) having multiple action-perception modalities, e.g. explicitly information transfer and implicit information transfer.   This treatise would be divided into three parts, and this first part provides an overview of the UIC model without introducing cumbersome mathematical analysis and optimizations. In the second part of this treatise, case studies with quantitative analysis driven by the UIC model would be provided, exemplifying the adoption of the UIC model in multi-agent system. Specifically, two representative cases would be studied, namely the analysis of a natural multi-agent system, as well as the co-design of communication, perception and action in an artificial multi-agent system. In the third part of this treatise, the paper provides further insights and future research directions motivated by the UIC model, such as unification of single intelligence and collective intelligence, a possible explanation of intelligence emergence and a dual model for agent-environment intelligence hypothesis.   Notes: This paper is a Previewed Version, the extended full-version would be released after being accepted.

TITLE: Responsible Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior
AUTHORS: Niko A. Grupen
ABSTRACT: Title: Responsible Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior
 Abstract: Responsible AI has risen to the forefront of the AI research community. As neural network-based learning algorithms continue to permeate real-world applications, the field of Responsible AI has played a large role in ensuring that such systems maintain a high-level of human-compatibility. Despite this progress, the state of the art in Responsible AI has ignored one crucial point: human problems are multi-agent problems. Predominant approaches largely consider the performance of a single AI system in isolation, but human problems are, by their very nature, multi-agent. From driving in traffic to negotiating economic policy, human problem-solving involves interaction and the interplay of the actions and motives of multiple individuals.   This dissertation develops the study of responsible emergent multi-agent behavior, illustrating how researchers and practitioners can better understand and shape multi-agent learning with respect to three pillars of Responsible AI: interpretability, fairness, and robustness. First, I investigate multi-agent interpretability, presenting novel techniques for understanding emergent multi-agent behavior at multiple levels of granularity. With respect to low-level interpretability, I examine the extent to which implicit communication emerges as an aid to coordination in multi-agent populations. I introduce a novel curriculum-driven method for learning high-performing policies in difficult, sparse reward environments and show through a measure of position-based social influence that multi-agent teams that learn sophisticated coordination strategies exchange significantly more information through implicit signals than lesser-coordinated agents. Then, at a high-level, I study concept-based interpretability in the context of multi-agent learning. I propose a novel method for learning intrinsically interpretable, concept-based policies and show that it enables...

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

TITLE: TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management
  in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems
AUTHORS: Shaina Raza, Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee, Christos Emmanouilidis
ABSTRACT: Title: TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management
  in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

ABSTRACT: Title: Collaboration of AI Agents via Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: There are many AI tasks involving multiple interacting agents where agents should learn to cooperate and collaborate to effectively perform the task. Here we develop and evaluate various multi-agent protocols to train agents to collaborate with teammates in grid soccer. We train and evaluate our multi-agent methods against a team operating with a smart hand-coded policy. As a baseline, we train agents concurrently and independently, with no communication. Our collaborative protocols were parameter sharing, coordinated learning with communication, and counterfactual policy gradients. Against the hand-coded team, the team trained with parameter sharing and the team trained with coordinated learning performed the best, scoring on 89.5% and 94.5% of episodes respectively when playing against the hand-coded team. Against the parameter sharing team, with adversarial training the coordinated learning team scored on 75% of the episodes, indicating it is the most adaptable of our methods. The insights gained from our work can be applied to other domains where multi-agent collaboration could be beneficial.

TITLE: TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management

ABSTRACT: Title: TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management
  in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

TITLE: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Conversational Task-Solving
AUTHORS: Jonas Becker
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Conversational Task-Solving
 Abstract: In an era where single large language models have dominated the landscape of artificial intelligence for years, multi-agent systems arise as new protagonists in conversational task-solving. While previous studies have showcased their potential in reasoning tasks and creative endeavors, an analysis of their limitations concerning the conversational paradigms and the impact of individual agents is missing. It remains unascertained how multi-agent discussions perform across tasks of varying complexity and how the structure of these conversations influences the process. To fill that gap, this work systematically evaluates multi-agent systems across various discussion paradigms, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in both generative tasks and question-answering tasks. Alongside the experiments, I propose a taxonomy of 20 multi-agent research studies from 2022 to 2024, followed by the introduction of a framework for deploying multi-agent LLMs in conversational task-solving. I demonstrate that while multi-agent systems excel in complex reasoning tasks, outperforming a single model by leveraging expert personas, they fail on basic tasks. Concretely, I identify three challenges that arise: 1) While longer discussions enhance reasoning, agents fail to maintain conformity to strict task requirements, which leads to problem drift, making shorter conversations more effective for basic tasks. 2) Prolonged discussions risk alignment collapse, raising new safety concerns for these systems. 3) I showcase discussion monopolization through long generations, posing the problem of fairness in decision-making for tasks like summarization. This work uncovers both the potential and challenges that arise with multi-agent interaction and varying conversational paradigms, providing insights into how future research could improve the efficiency, performance, and safety of multi-agent LLMs.

ABSTRACT: Title: Improving Multi-Agent Debate with Sparse Communication Topology
 Abstract: Multi-agent debate has proven effective in improving large language models quality for reasoning and factuality tasks. While various role-playing strategies in multi-agent debates have been explored, in terms of the communication among agents, existing approaches adopt a brute force algorithm -- each agent can communicate with all other agents. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of communication connectivity in multi-agent systems. Our experiments on GPT and Mistral models reveal that multi-agent debates leveraging sparse communication topology can achieve comparable or superior performance while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we extend the multi-agent debate framework to multimodal reasoning and alignment labeling tasks, showcasing its broad applicability and effectiveness. Our findings underscore the importance of communication connectivity on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the "society of minds" approach.

ABSTRACT: Title: Literature Review Of Multi-Agent Debate For Problem-Solving
 Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

ABSTRACT: Title: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Complex Engineering Problem-Solving: A
  Framework for Senior Design Projects
 Abstract: Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of...

TITLE: Algebras for Agent Norm-Regulation
AUTHORS: Jan Odelstad, Magnus Boman
ABSTRACT: Title: Algebras for Agent Norm-Regulation
 Abstract: An abstract architecture for idealized multi-agent systems whose behaviour is regulated by normative systems is developed and discussed. Agent choices are determined partially by the preference ordering of possible states and partially by normative considerations: The agent chooses that act which leads to the best outcome of all permissible actions. If an action is non-permissible depends on if the result of performing that action leads to a state satisfying a condition which is forbidden, according to the norms regulating the multi-agent system. This idea is formalized by defining set-theoretic predicates characterizing multi-agent systems. The definition of the predicate uses decision theory, the Kanger-Lindahl theory of normative positions, and an algebraic representation of normative systems.

AUTHORS: Sagar Sudhakara
ABSTRACT: Title: Symmetric Policy Design for Multi-Agent Dispatch Coordination in Supply
  Chains
 Abstract: We study a decentralized dispatch coordination problem in a multi-agent supply chain setting with shared logistics capacity. We propose symmetric (identical) dispatch strategies for all agents, enabling efficient coordination without centralized control. Using a common information approach, we derive a dynamic programming solution that computes optimal symmetric dispatch strategies by transforming the multi-agent problem into a tractable dynamic program on the agents common information state. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces coordination cost compared to baseline heuristics, including belief-based strategies and an always-dispatch policy. These findings highlight the benefits of combining symmetric strategy design with a common information-based dynamic programming framework for improving multi-agent coordination performance.

TITLE: TAPE: Leveraging Agent Topology for Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy
  Gradient

ABSTRACT: Title: TAPE: Leveraging Agent Topology for Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy
  Gradient
 Abstract: Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (MAPG) has made significant progress in recent years. However, centralized critics in state-of-the-art MAPG methods still face the centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) issue, which means sub-optimal actions by some agents will affect other agent's policy learning. While using individual critics for policy updates can avoid this issue, they severely limit cooperation among agents. To address this issue, we propose an agent topology framework, which decides whether other agents should be considered in policy gradient and achieves compromise between facilitating cooperation and alleviating the CDM issue. The agent topology allows agents to use coalition utility as learning objective instead of global utility by centralized critics or local utility by individual critics. To constitute the agent topology, various models are studied. We propose Topology-based multi-Agent Policy gradiEnt (TAPE) for both stochastic and deterministic MAPG methods. We prove the policy improvement theorem for stochastic TAPE and give a theoretical explanation for the improved cooperation among agents. Experiment results on several benchmarks show the agent topology is able to facilitate agent cooperation and alleviate CDM issue respectively to improve performance of TAPE. Finally, multiple ablation studies and a heuristic graph search algorithm are devised to show the efficacy of the agent topology.

TITLE: On Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems
AUTHORS: R. I. Brafman, M. Tennenholtz
ABSTRACT: Title: On Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship.

TITLE: Mediated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Dmitry Ivanov, Ilya Zisman, Kirill Chernyshev
ABSTRACT: Title: Mediated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: The majority of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) literature equates the cooperation of self-interested agents in mixed environments to the problem of social welfare maximization, allowing agents to arbitrarily share rewards and private information. This results in agents that forgo their individual goals in favour of social good, which can potentially be exploited by selfish defectors. We argue that cooperation also requires agents' identities and boundaries to be respected by making sure that the emergent behaviour is an equilibrium, i.e., a convention that no agent can deviate from and receive higher individual payoffs. Inspired by advances in mechanism design, we propose to solve the problem of cooperation, defined as finding socially beneficial equilibrium, by using mediators. A mediator is a benevolent entity that may act on behalf of agents, but only for the agents that agree to it. We show how a mediator can be trained alongside agents with policy gradient to maximize social welfare subject to constraints that encourage agents to cooperate through the mediator. Our experiments in matrix and iterative games highlight the potential power of applying mediators in MARL.

ABSTRACT: Title: The Athenian Academy: A Seven-Layer Architecture Model for Multi-Agent
  Systems
 Abstract: This paper proposes the "Academy of Athens" multi-agent seven-layer framework, aimed at systematically addressing challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism. The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration, single-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal, single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative applications in the art field.

TITLE: Responsible Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior

ABSTRACT: Title: Responsible Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior
 Abstract: Responsible AI has risen to the forefront of the AI research community. As neural network-based learning algorithms continue to permeate real-world applications, the field of Responsible AI has played a large role in ensuring that such systems maintain a high-level of human-compatibility. Despite this progress, the state of the art in Responsible AI has ignored one crucial point: human problems are multi-agent problems. Predominant approaches largely consider the performance of a single AI system in isolation, but human problems are, by their very nature, multi-agent. From driving in traffic to negotiating economic policy, human problem-solving involves interaction and the interplay of the actions and motives of multiple individuals.   This dissertation develops the study of responsible emergent multi-agent behavior, illustrating how researchers and practitioners can better understand and shape multi-agent learning with respect to three pillars of Responsible AI: interpretability, fairness, and robustness. First, I investigate multi-agent interpretability, presenting novel techniques for understanding emergent multi-agent behavior at multiple levels of granularity. With respect to low-level interpretability, I examine the extent to which implicit communication emerges as an aid to coordination in multi-agent populations. I introduce a novel curriculum-driven method for learning high-performing policies in difficult, sparse reward environments and show through a measure of position-based social influence that multi-agent teams that learn sophisticated coordination strategies exchange significantly more information through implicit signals than lesser-coordinated agents. Then, at a high-level, I study concept-based interpretability in the context of multi-agent learning. I propose a novel method for learning intrinsically interpretable, concept-based policies and show that it enables...

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

TITLE: Order Matters: Agent-by-agent Policy Optimization
AUTHORS: Xihuai Wang, Zheng Tian, Ziyu Wan, Ying Wen, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: Order Matters: Agent-by-agent Policy Optimization
 Abstract: While multi-agent trust region algorithms have achieved great success empirically in solving coordination tasks, most of them, however, suffer from a non-stationarity problem since agents update their policies simultaneously. In contrast, a sequential scheme that updates policies agent-by-agent provides another perspective and shows strong performance. However, sample inefficiency and lack of monotonic improvement guarantees for each agent are still the two significant challenges for the sequential scheme. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{A}gent-by-\textbf{a}gent \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (A2PO) algorithm to improve the sample efficiency and retain the guarantees of monotonic improvement for each agent during training. We justify the tightness of the monotonic improvement bound compared with other trust region algorithms. From the perspective of sequentially updating agents, we further consider the effect of agent updating order and extend the theory of non-stationarity into the sequential update scheme. To evaluate A2PO, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four benchmarks: StarCraftII, Multi-agent MuJoCo, Multi-agent Particle Environment, and Google Research Football full game scenarios. A2PO consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TITLE: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Multi-Agent Trust Region Optimization

ABSTRACT: Title: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Multi-Agent Trust Region Optimization
 Abstract: Trust region methods are widely applied in single-agent reinforcement learning problems due to their monotonic performance-improvement guarantee at every iteration. Nonetheless, when applied in multi-agent settings, the guarantee of trust region methods no longer holds because an agent's payoff is also affected by other agents' adaptive behaviors. To tackle this problem, we conduct a game-theoretical analysis in the policy space, and propose a multi-agent trust region learning method (MATRL), which enables trust region optimization for multi-agent learning. Specifically, MATRL finds a stable improvement direction that is guided by the solution concept of Nash equilibrium at the meta-game level. We derive the monotonic improvement guarantee in multi-agent settings and empirically show the local convergence of MATRL to stable fixed points in the two-player rotational differential game. To test our method, we evaluate MATRL in both discrete and continuous multiplayer general-sum games including checker and switch grid worlds, multi-agent MuJoCo, and Atari games. Results suggest that MATRL significantly outperforms strong multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines.

TITLE: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

TITLE: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients
AUTHORS: Yihan Wang, Beining Han, Tonghan Wang, Heng Dong, Chongjie Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients
 Abstract: Multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods recently witness vigorous progress. However, there is a significant performance discrepancy between MAPG methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent value-based approaches. In this paper, we investigate causes that hinder the performance of MAPG algorithms and present a multi-agent decomposed policy gradient method (DOP). This method introduces the idea of value function decomposition into the multi-agent actor-critic framework. Based on this idea, DOP supports efficient off-policy learning and addresses the issue of centralized-decentralized mismatch and credit assignment in both discrete and continuous action spaces. We formally show that DOP critics have sufficient representational capability to guarantee convergence. In addition, empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that DOP significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art value-based and policy-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Demonstrative videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/dop-mapg/.

TITLE: Large Language Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for 6G Communications
AUTHORS: Feibo Jiang, Li Dong, Yubo Peng, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan, Dusit Niyato, Octavia A. Dobre
ABSTRACT: Title: Large Language Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for 6G Communications
 Abstract: The rapid development of the Large Language Model (LLM) presents huge opportunities for 6G communications, e.g., network optimization and management by allowing users to input task requirements to LLMs by nature language. However, directly applying native LLMs in 6G encounters various challenges, such as a lack of private communication data and knowledge, limited logical reasoning, evaluation, and refinement abilities. Integrating LLMs with the capabilities of retrieval, planning, memory, evaluation and reflection in agents can greatly enhance the potential of LLMs for 6G communications. To this end, we propose a multi-agent system with customized communication knowledge and tools for solving communication related tasks using natural language, comprising three components: (1) Multi-agent Data Retrieval (MDR), which employs the condensate and inference agents to refine and summarize communication knowledge from the knowledge base, expanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs in 6G communications; (2) Multi-agent Collaborative Planning (MCP), which utilizes multiple planning agents to generate feasible solutions for the communication related task from different perspectives based on the retrieved knowledge; (3) Multi-agent Evaluation and Reflecxion (MER), which utilizes the evaluation agent to assess the solutions, and applies the reflexion agent and refinement agent to provide improvement suggestions for current solutions. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-agent system by designing a semantic communication system, as a case study of 6G communications.

TITLE: Maximum-Entropy Multi-Agent Dynamic Games: Forward and Inverse Solutions
AUTHORS: Negar Mehr, Mingyu Wang, Mac Schwager
ABSTRACT: Title: Maximum-Entropy Multi-Agent Dynamic Games: Forward and Inverse Solutions
 Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of multiple stochastic agents interacting in a dynamic game scenario with continuous state and action spaces. We define a new notion of stochastic Nash equilibrium for boundedly rational agents, which we call the Entropic Cost Equilibrium (ECE). We show that ECE is a natural extension to multiple agents of Maximum Entropy optimality for single agents. We solve both the "forward" and "inverse" problems for the multi-agent ECE game. For the forward problem, we provide a Riccati algorithm to compute closed-form ECE feedback policies for the agents, which are exact in the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian case. We give an iterative variant to find locally ECE feedback policies for the nonlinear case. For the inverse problem, we present an algorithm to infer the cost functions of the multiple interacting agents given noisy, boundedly rational input and state trajectory examples from agents acting in an ECE. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated in a simulated multi-agent collision avoidance scenario, and with data from the INTERACTION traffic dataset. In both cases, we show that, by taking into account the agents' game theoretic interactions using our algorithm, a more accurate model of agents' costs can be learned, compared with standard inverse optimal control methods.

ABSTRACT: Title: Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Learning to collaborate has witnessed significant progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, promoting coordination among agents and enhancing exploration capabilities remain challenges. In multi-agent environments, interactions between agents are limited in specific situations. Effective collaboration between agents thus requires a nuanced understanding of when and how agents' actions influence others. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel MARL algorithm named Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SCIC), which incorporates a novel Intrinsic reward mechanism based on a new cooperation criterion measured by situation-dependent causal influence among agents. Our approach aims to detect inter-agent causal influences in specific situations based on the criterion using causal intervention and conditional mutual information. This effectively assists agents in exploring states that can positively impact other agents, thus promoting cooperation between agents. The resulting update links coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution, which enhance overall collaboration and performance. Experimental results on various MARL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

ABSTRACT: Title: Factorized Q-Learning for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Deep Q-learning has achieved significant success in single-agent decision making tasks. However, it is challenging to extend Q-learning to large-scale multi-agent scenarios, due to the explosion of action space resulting from the complex dynamics between the environment and the agents. In this paper, we propose to make the computation of multi-agent Q-learning tractable by treating the Q-function (w.r.t. state and joint-action) as a high-order high-dimensional tensor and then approximate it with factorized pairwise interactions. Furthermore, we utilize a composite deep neural network architecture for computing the factorized Q-function, share the model parameters among all the agents within the same group, and estimate the agents' optimal joint actions through a coordinate descent type algorithm. All these simplifications greatly reduce the model complexity and accelerate the learning process. Extensive experiments on two different multi-agent problems demonstrate the performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison with strong baselines, particularly when there are a large number of agents.

ABSTRACT: Title: SocialGFs: Learning Social Gradient Fields for Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) need to adaptively cope with dynamic environments, changing agent populations, and diverse tasks. However, most of the multi-agent systems cannot easily handle them, due to the complexity of the state and task space. The social impact theory regards the complex influencing factors as forces acting on an agent, emanating from the environment, other agents, and the agent's intrinsic motivation, referring to the social force. Inspired by this concept, we propose a novel gradient-based state representation for multi-agent reinforcement learning. To non-trivially model the social forces, we further introduce a data-driven method, where we employ denoising score matching to learn the social gradient fields (SocialGFs) from offline samples, e.g., the attractive or repulsive outcomes of each force. During interactions, the agents take actions based on the multi-dimensional gradients to maximize their own rewards. In practice, we integrate SocialGFs into the widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., MAPPO. The empirical results reveal that SocialGFs offer four advantages for multi-agent systems: 1) they can be learned without requiring online interaction, 2) they demonstrate transferability across diverse tasks, 3) they facilitate credit assignment in challenging reward settings, and 4) they are scalable with the increasing number of agents.

ABSTRACT: Title: Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), a curriculum learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin as the number of agents grows exponentially.

ABSTRACT: Title: SpeechAgents: Human-Communication Simulation with Multi-Modal
  Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Human communication is a complex and diverse process that not only involves multiple factors such as language, commonsense, and cultural backgrounds but also requires the participation of multimodal information, such as speech. Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated promising performance in simulating human society. Can we leverage LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? However, current LLM-based multi-agent systems mainly rely on text as the primary medium. In this paper, we propose SpeechAgents, a multi-modal LLM based multi-agent system designed for simulating human communication. SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLM as the control center for individual agent and employes multi-modal signals as the medium for exchanged messages among agents. Additionally, we propose Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without compromising general abilities. To strengthen and evaluate the effectiveness of human communication simulation, we build the Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SpeechAgents can simulate human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions and demonstrate excellent scalability even with up to 25 agents, which can apply to tasks such as drama creation and audio novels generation.

ABSTRACT: Title: Reaching Consensus in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  with Goal Imagination
 Abstract: Reaching consensus is key to multi-agent coordination. To accomplish a cooperative task, agents need to coherently select optimal joint actions to maximize the team reward. However, current cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods usually do not explicitly take consensus into consideration, which may cause miscoordination problem. In this paper, we propose a model-based consensus mechanism to explicitly coordinate multiple agents. The proposed Multi-agent Goal Imagination (MAGI) framework guides agents to reach consensus with an Imagined common goal. The common goal is an achievable state with high value, which is obtained by sampling from the distribution of future states. We directly model this distribution with a self-supervised generative model, thus alleviating the "curse of dimensinality" problem induced by multi-agent multi-step policy rollout commonly used in model-based methods. We show that such efficient consensus mechanism can guide all agents cooperatively reaching valuable future states. Results on Multi-agent Particle-Environments and Google Research Football environment demonstrate the superiority of MAGI in both sample efficiency and performance.

ABSTRACT: Title: GroupDebate: Enhancing the Efficiency of Multi-Agent Debate Using Group
  Discussion
 Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse NLP tasks. Extensive research has explored how to enhance the logical reasoning abilities such as Chain-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency, Tree-Of-Thoughts, and multi-agent debates. In the context of multi-agent debates, significant performance improvements can be achieved with an increasing number of agents and debate rounds. However, the escalation in the number of agents and debate rounds can drastically raise the tokens cost of debates, thereby limiting the scalability of the multi-agent debate technique. To better harness the advantages of multi-agent debates in logical reasoning tasks, this paper proposes a method to significantly reduce token cost in multi-agent debates. This approach involves dividing all agents into multiple debate groups, with agents engaging in debates within their respective groups and sharing interim debate results between groups. Comparative experiments across multiple datasets have demonstrated that this method can reduce the total tokens by up to 51.7% during debates and while potentially enhancing accuracy by as much as 25%. Our method significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of interactions in the multi-agent debate.

ABSTRACT: Title: Learning from Good Trajectories in Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to learn effective multi-agent policies from pre-collected datasets, which is an important step toward the deployment of multi-agent systems in real-world applications. However, in practice, each individual behavior policy that generates multi-agent joint trajectories usually has a different level of how well it performs. e.g., an agent is a random policy while other agents are medium policies. In the cooperative game with global reward, one agent learned by existing offline MARL often inherits this random policy, jeopardizing the performance of the entire team. In this paper, we investigate offline MARL with explicit consideration on the diversity of agent-wise trajectories and propose a novel framework called Shared Individual Trajectories (SIT) to address this problem. Specifically, an attention-based reward decomposition network assigns the credit to each agent through a differentiable key-value memory mechanism in an offline manner. These decomposed credits are then used to reconstruct the joint offline datasets into prioritized experience replay with individual trajectories, thereafter agents can share their good trajectories and conservatively train their policies with a graph attention network (GAT) based critic. We evaluate our method in both discrete control (i.e., StarCraft II and multi-agent particle environment) and continuous control (i.e, multi-agent mujoco). The results indicate that our method achieves significantly better results in complex and mixed offline multi-agent datasets, especially when the difference of data quality between individual trajectories is large.

ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Imitation Learning with Copulas
 Abstract: Multi-agent imitation learning aims to train multiple agents to perform tasks from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions, which is essential for understanding physical, social, and team-play systems. However, most existing works on modeling multi-agent interactions typically assume that agents make independent decisions based on their observations, ignoring the complex dependence among agents. In this paper, we propose to use copula, a powerful statistical tool for capturing dependence among random variables, to explicitly model the correlation and coordination in multi-agent systems. Our proposed model is able to separately learn marginals that capture the local behavioral patterns of each individual agent, as well as a copula function that solely and fully captures the dependence structure among agents. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios in the action prediction task, and is able to generate new trajectories close to expert demonstrations.

ABSTRACT: Title: Learning with Limited Shared Information in Multi-agent Multi-armed
  Bandit
 Abstract: Multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) is a classic collaborative learning model and has gained much attention in recent years. However, existing studies do not consider the case where an agent may refuse to share all her information with others, e.g., when some of the data contains personal privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel limited shared information multi-agent multi-armed bandit (LSI-MAMAB) model in which each agent only shares the information that she is willing to share, and propose the Balanced-ETC algorithm to help multiple agents collaborate efficiently with limited shared information. Our analysis shows that Balanced-ETC is asymptotically optimal and its average regret (on each agent) approaches a constant when there are sufficient agents involved. Moreover, to encourage agents to participate in this collaborative learning, an incentive mechanism is proposed to make sure each agent can benefit from the collaboration system. Finally, we present experimental results to validate our theoretical results.

ABSTRACT: Title: PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack,
  Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.

ABSTRACT: Title: A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication
 Abstract: Communication is an effective mechanism for coordinating the behaviors of multiple agents, broadening their views of the environment, and to support their collaborations. In the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can improve the overall learning performance and achieve their objectives by communication. Agents can communicate various types of messages, either to all agents or to specific agent groups, or conditioned on specific constraints. With the growing body of research work in MADRL with communication (Comm-MADRL), there is a lack of a systematic and structural approach to distinguish and classify existing Comm-MADRL approaches. In this paper, we survey recent works in the Comm-MADRL field and consider various aspects of communication that can play a role in designing and developing multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. With these aspects in mind, we propose 9 dimensions along which Comm-MADRL approaches can be analyzed, developed, and compared. By projecting existing works into the multi-dimensional space, we discover interesting trends. We also propose some novel directions for designing future Comm-MADRL systems through exploring possible combinations of the dimensions.

 Abstract: In this paper, from the structural perspective, we propose a new stability analysis approach for the consensus of linear multi-agent systems. Different from the general tools: the Laplacian matrix based method and the Lyapunov's method, this approach treats the multi-agent system as the composition of many isolated agents, and focuses on their special input and output relationship. Through transforming the construction of a graph into a standard procedure only including three basic structures, the stability analysis is recursive and independent of the specific topology. Therefore, this approach can be used for multi-agent systems on any topology graph.

ABSTRACT: Title: Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks for Learning Diverse
  Communication
 Abstract: Multi-agent teaming achieves better performance when there is communication among participating agents allowing them to coordinate their actions for maximizing shared utility. However, when collaborating a team of agents with different action and observation spaces, information sharing is not straightforward and requires customized communication protocols, depending on sender and receiver types. Without properly modeling such heterogeneity in agents, communication becomes less helpful and could even deteriorate the multi-agent cooperation performance. We propose heterogeneous graph attention networks, called HetNet, to learn efficient and diverse communication models for coordinating heterogeneous agents towards accomplishing tasks that are of collaborative nature. We propose a Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Actor-Critic (MAHAC) learning paradigm to obtain collaborative per-class policies and effective communication protocols for composite robot teams. Our proposed framework is evaluated against multiple baselines in a complex environment in which agents of different types must communicate and cooperate to satisfy the objectives. Experimental results show that HetNet outperforms the baselines in learning sophisticated multi-agent communication protocols by achieving $\sim$10\% improvements in performance metrics.

ABSTRACT: Title: Promoting Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Mutual

 Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved great progress in cooperative tasks in recent years. However, in the local reward scheme, where only local rewards for each agent are given without global rewards shared by all the agents, traditional MARL algorithms lack sufficient consideration of agents' mutual influence. In cooperative tasks, agents' mutual influence is especially important since agents are supposed to coordinate to achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm Mutual-Help-based MARL (MH-MARL) to instruct agents to help each other in order to promote cooperation. MH-MARL utilizes an expected action module to generate expected other agents' actions for each particular agent. Then, the expected actions are delivered to other agents for selective imitation during training. Experimental results show that MH-MARL improves the performance of MARL both in success rate and cumulative reward.

 Abstract: In this paper, a discrete-time multi-agent system is presented which is formulated in terms of the delta operator. The proposed multi-agent system can unify discrete-time and continuous-time multi-agent systems. In a multi-agent network, in practice, the communication among agents is acted upon by various factors. The communication network among faulty agents may cause link failures, which is modeled by randomly switching graphs. First, we show that the delta representation of discrete-time multi-agent system reaches consensus in mean (in probability and almost surely) if the expected graph is strongly connected. The results induce that the continuous-time multi-agent system with random networks can also reach consensus in the same sense. Second, the influence of faulty agents on consensus value is quantified under original network. By using matrix perturbation theory, the error bound is also presented in this paper. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

TITLE: Kernel Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Contextual Bandits
AUTHORS: Abhimanyu Dubey, Alex Pentland
ABSTRACT: Title: Kernel Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Contextual Bandits
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent decision making involves a group of agents cooperatively solving learning problems while communicating over a network with delays. In this paper, we consider the kernelised contextual bandit problem, where the reward obtained by an agent is an arbitrary linear function of the contexts' images in the related reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a group of agents must cooperate to collectively solve their unique decision problems. For this problem, we propose \textsc{Coop-KernelUCB}, an algorithm that provides near-optimal bounds on the per-agent regret, and is both computationally and communicatively efficient. For special cases of the cooperative problem, we also provide variants of \textsc{Coop-KernelUCB} that provides optimal per-agent regret. In addition, our algorithm generalizes several existing results in the multi-agent bandit setting. Finally, on a series of both synthetic and real-world multi-agent network benchmarks, we demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

TITLE: Kernel Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Contextual Bandits
AUTHORS: Abhimanyu Dubey, Alex Pentland
ABSTRACT: Title: Kernel Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Contextual Bandits
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent decision making involves a group of agents cooperatively solving learning problems while communicating over a network with delays. In this paper, we consider the kernelised contextual bandit problem, where the reward obtained by an agent is an arbitrary linear function of the contexts' images in the related reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a group of agents must cooperate to collectively solve their unique decision problems. For this problem, we propose \textsc{Coop-KernelUCB}, an algorithm that provides near-optimal bounds on the per-agent regret, and is both computationally and communicatively efficient. For special cases of the cooperative problem, we also provide variants of \textsc{Coop-KernelUCB} that provides optimal per-agent regret. In addition, our algorithm generalizes several existing results in the multi-agent bandit setting. Finally, on a series of both synthetic and real-world multi-agent network benchmarks, we demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

TITLE: Connectivity-Preserving Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems with Bounded
  Actuation
AUTHORS: Yuan Yang, Daniela Constantinescu, Yang Shi
ABSTRACT: Title: Connectivity-Preserving Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems with Bounded
  Actuation
 Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of bounded actuation on the connectivity-preserving consensus of two classes of multi-agent systems, with kinematic agents and with Euler- Lagrange agents. The investigation establishes that: (1) there exists a class of gradient-based controls which drive kinematic multi-agent systems to connectivity-preserving consensus even if they saturate; (2) actuator saturation restricts the initial states from which Euler-Lagrange multi-agent systems can be synchronized while preserving their local connectivity; (3) Euler-Lagrange multi-agent systems with unbounded actuation can achieve connectivity-preserving consensus without velocity measurements or exact system dynamics; and (4) a proposed indirect coupling control strategy drives Euler-Lagrange multi-agent systems with limited actuation and starting from rest to connectivitypreserving consensus without requiring velocity measurements and including in the presence of uncertain dynamics and timevarying delays.

               4. Mention specific papers or authors when relevant, using the source numbers (e.g., [1], [2]).
               5. If you cannot find information about a specific author, clearly state "No papers by [author name] were found in the provided context."
               6. Use academic language appropriate for research.
               7. At the end of your generated answer, list the sources you have used as a reference, in this format:

              References:

                [1] Title of first paper - Authors

                [2] Title of second paper - Authors

                [3] Title of third paper - Authors

                Only cite papers that are directly relevant to the answer. 

                Make sure each reference is on its own line with proper spacing.

TITLE: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Wesley Suttle, Zhuoran Yang, Kaiqing Zhang, Zhaoran Wang, Tamer Basar, Ji Liu
ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: This paper extends off-policy reinforcement learning to the multi-agent case in which a set of networked agents communicating with their neighbors according to a time-varying graph collaboratively evaluates and improves a target policy while following a distinct behavior policy. To this end, the paper develops a multi-agent version of emphatic temporal difference learning for off-policy policy evaluation, and proves convergence under linear function approximation. The paper then leverages this result, in conjunction with a novel multi-agent off-policy policy gradient theorem and recent work in both multi-agent on-policy and single-agent off-policy actor-critic methods, to develop and give convergence guarantees for a new multi-agent off-policy actor-critic algorithm.

TITLE: Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Baicen Xiao, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Radha Poovendran
ABSTRACT: Title: Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: This paper considers multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks where agents receive a shared global reward at the end of an episode. The delayed nature of this reward affects the ability of the agents to assess the quality of their actions at intermediate time-steps. This paper focuses on developing methods to learn a temporal redistribution of the episodic reward to obtain a dense reward signal. Solving such MARL problems requires addressing two challenges: identifying (1) relative importance of states along the length of an episode (along time), and (2) relative importance of individual agents' states at any single time-step (among agents). In this paper, we introduce Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (AREL) to address these two challenges. AREL uses attention mechanisms to characterize the influence of actions on state transitions along trajectories (temporal attention), and how each agent is affected by other agents at each time-step (agent attention). The redistributed rewards predicted by AREL are dense, and can be integrated with any given MARL algorithm. We evaluate AREL on challenging tasks from the Particle World environment and the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. AREL results in higher rewards in Particle World, and improved win rates in StarCraft compared to three state-of-the-art reward redistribution methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/baicenxiao/AREL.

AUTHORS: Siyi Hu, Chuanlong Xie, Xiaodan Liang, Xiaojun Chang
ABSTRACT: Title: Policy Diagnosis via Measuring Role Diversity in Cooperative Multi-agent
  RL
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is making rapid progress for solving tasks in a grid world and real-world scenarios, in which agents are given different attributes and goals, resulting in different behavior through the whole multi-agent task. In this study, we quantify the agent's behavior difference and build its relationship with the policy performance via {\bf Role Diversity}, a metric to measure the characteristics of MARL tasks. We define role diversity from three perspectives: action-based, trajectory-based, and contribution-based to fully measure a multi-agent task. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the error bound in MARL can be decomposed into three parts that have a strong relation to the role diversity. The decomposed factors can significantly impact policy optimization on three popular directions including parameter sharing, communication mechanism, and credit assignment. The main experimental platforms are based on {\bf Multiagent Particle Environment (MPE)} and {\bf The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Extensive experiments} clearly show that role diversity can serve as a robust measurement for the characteristics of a multi-agent cooperation task and help diagnose whether the policy fits the current multi-agent system for a better policy performance.

  Re-Assignment for Interactive Environment Generalization

ABSTRACT: Title: Enhancing Language Multi-Agent Learning with Multi-Agent Credit
  Re-Assignment for Interactive Environment Generalization
 Abstract: LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

ABSTRACT: Title: Graph-Theoretic Characterizations of Structural Controllability for
  Multi-Agent System with Switching Topology
 Abstract: This paper considers the controllability problem for multi-agent systems. In particular, the structural controllability of multi-agent systems under switching topologies is investigated. The structural controllability of multi-agent systems is a generalization of the traditional controllability concept for dynamical systems, and purely based on the communication topologies among agents. The main contributions of the paper are graph-theoretic characterizations of the structural controllability for multi-agent systems. It turns out that the multi-agent system with switching topology is structurally controllable if and only if the union graph G of the underlying communication topologies is connected (single leader) or leader-follower connected (multi-leader). Finally, the paper concludes with several illustrative examples and discussions of the results and future work.

  Learning
AUTHORS: Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
ABSTRACT: Title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

ABSTRACT: Title: Decentralized Adaptive Formation via Consensus-Oriented Multi-Agent
  Communication
 Abstract: Adaptive multi-agent formation control, which requires the formation to flexibly adjust along with the quantity variations of agents in a decentralized manner, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in multi-agent systems, especially under communication-limited constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Consensus-based Decentralized Adaptive Formation (Cons-DecAF) framework. Specifically, we develop a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication (ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish the consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages. Afterwards, we leverage policy distillation to accomplish the adaptive formation adjustment. Meanwhile, instead of pre-assigning specific positions of agents, we employ a displacement-based formation by Hausdorff distance to significantly improve the formation efficiency. The experimental results through extensive simulations validate that the proposed method has achieved outstanding performance in terms of both speed and stability.

ABSTRACT: Title: CH-MARL: A Multimodal Benchmark for Cooperative, Heterogeneous
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: We propose a multimodal (vision-and-language) benchmark for cooperative and heterogeneous multi-agent learning. We introduce a benchmark multimodal dataset with tasks involving collaboration between multiple simulated heterogeneous robots in a rich multi-room home environment. We provide an integrated learning framework, multimodal implementations of state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, and a consistent evaluation protocol. Our experiments investigate the impact of different modalities on multi-agent learning performance. We also introduce a simple message passing method between agents. The results suggest that multimodality introduces unique challenges for cooperative multi-agent learning and there is significant room for advancing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods in such settings.

TITLE: Skill Discovery of Coordination in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Shuncheng He, Jianzhun Shao, Xiangyang Ji
ABSTRACT: Title: Skill Discovery of Coordination in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery drives intelligent agents to explore the unknown environment without task-specific reward signal, and the agents acquire various skills which may be useful when the agents adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we propose "Multi-agent Skill Discovery"(MASD), a method for discovering skills for coordination patterns of multiple agents. The proposed method aims to maximize the mutual information between a latent code Z representing skills and the combination of the states of all agents. Meanwhile it suppresses the empowerment of Z on the state of any single agent by adversarial training. In another word, it sets an information bottleneck to avoid empowerment degeneracy. First we show the emergence of various skills on the level of coordination in a general particle multi-agent environment. Second, we reveal that the "bottleneck" prevents skills from collapsing to a single agent and enhances the diversity of learned skills. Finally, we show the pretrained policies have better performance on supervised RL tasks.

  Advantage Estimation
AUTHORS: Lipeng Wan, Xuwei Song, Xuguang Lan, Nanning Zheng
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-agent Policy Optimization with Approximatively Synchronous
  Advantage Estimation
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent tasks require agents to deduce their own contributions with shared global rewards, known as the challenge of credit assignment. General methods for policy based multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve the challenge introduce differentiate value functions or advantage functions for individual agents. In multi-agent system, polices of different agents need to be evaluated jointly. In order to update polices synchronously, such value functions or advantage functions also need synchronous evaluation. However, in current methods, value functions or advantage functions use counter-factual joint actions which are evaluated asynchronously, thus suffer from natural estimation bias. In this work, we propose the approximatively synchronous advantage estimation. We first derive the marginal advantage function, an expansion from single-agent advantage function to multi-agent system. Further more, we introduce a policy approximation for synchronous advantage estimation, and break down the multi-agent policy optimization problem into multiple sub-problems of single-agent policy optimization. Our method is compared with baseline algorithms on StarCraft multi-agent challenges, and shows the best performance on most of the tasks.

ABSTRACT: Title: Active collaboration in relative observation for Multi-agent visual SLAM
  based on Deep Q Network
 Abstract: This paper proposes a unique active relative localization mechanism for multi-agent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM),in which a agent to be observed are considered as a task, which is performed by others assisting that agent by relative observation. A task allocation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning are proposed for this mechanism. Each agent can choose whether to localize other agents or to continue independent SLAM on it own initiative. By this way, the process of each agent SLAM will be interacted by the collaboration. Firstly, based on the characteristics of ORBSLAM, a unique observation function which models the whole MAS is obtained. Secondly, a novel type of Deep Q network(DQN) called MAS-DQN is deployed to learn correspondence between Q Value and state-action pair,abstract representation of agents in MAS are learned in the process of collaboration among agents. Finally, each agent must act with a certain degree of freedom according to MAS-DQN. The simulation results of comparative experiments prove that this mechanism improves the efficiency of cooperation in the process of multi-agent SLAM.

AUTHORS: Zixian Ma, Rose Wang, Li Fei-Fei, Michael Bernstein, Ranjay Krishna
ABSTRACT: Title: ELIGN: Expectation Alignment as a Multi-Agent Intrinsic Reward
 Abstract: Modern multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks rely on centralized training and reward shaping to perform well. However, centralized training and dense rewards are not readily available in the real world. Current multi-agent algorithms struggle to learn in the alternative setup of decentralized training or sparse rewards. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised intrinsic reward ELIGN - expectation alignment - inspired by the self-organization principle in Zoology. Similar to how animals collaborate in a decentralized manner with those in their vicinity, agents trained with expectation alignment learn behaviors that match their neighbors' expectations. This allows the agents to learn collaborative behaviors without any external reward or centralized training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across 6 tasks in the multi-agent particle and the complex Google Research football environments, comparing ELIGN to sparse and curiosity-based intrinsic rewards. When the number of agents increases, ELIGN scales well in all multi-agent tasks except for one where agents have different capabilities. We show that agent coordination improves through expectation alignment because agents learn to divide tasks amongst themselves, break coordination symmetries, and confuse adversaries. These results identify tasks where expectation alignment is a more useful strategy than curiosity-driven exploration for multi-agent coordination, enabling agents to do zero-shot coordination.

  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Xiao Du, Yutong Ye, Pengyu Zhang, Yaning Yang, Mingsong Chen, Ting Wang
ABSTRACT: Title: Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Learning to collaborate has witnessed significant progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, promoting coordination among agents and enhancing exploration capabilities remain challenges. In multi-agent environments, interactions between agents are limited in specific situations. Effective collaboration between agents thus requires a nuanced understanding of when and how agents' actions influence others. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel MARL algorithm named Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SCIC), which incorporates a novel Intrinsic reward mechanism based on a new cooperation criterion measured by situation-dependent causal influence among agents. Our approach aims to detect inter-agent causal influences in specific situations based on the criterion using causal intervention and conditional mutual information. This effectively assists agents in exploring states that can positively impact other agents, thus promoting cooperation between agents. The resulting update links coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution, which enhance overall collaboration and performance. Experimental results on various MARL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

ABSTRACT: Title: Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), a curriculum learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin as the number of agents grows exponentially.

TITLE: RPM: Generalizable Behaviors for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Wei Qiu, Xiao Ma, Bo An, Svetlana Obraztsova, Shuicheng Yan, Zhongwen Xu
ABSTRACT: Title: RPM: Generalizable Behaviors for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Despite the recent advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the MARL agents easily overfit the training environment and perform poorly in the evaluation scenarios where other agents behave differently. Obtaining generalizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly due to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, we model the problem with Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, ranked policy memory (RPM), to collect diverse multi-agent trajectories for training MARL policies with good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to maintain a look-up memory of policies. In particular, we try to acquire various levels of behaviors by saving policies via ranking the training episode return, i.e., the episode return of agents in the training environment; when an episode starts, the learning agent can then choose a policy from the RPM as the behavior policy. This innovative self-play training framework leverages agents' past policies and guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the training data. We implement RPM on top of MARL algorithms and conduct extensive experiments on Melting Pot. It has been demonstrated that RPM enables MARL agents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation scenarios and complete given tasks, and it significantly boosts the performance up to 402% on average.

TITLE: Mingling Foresight with Imagination: Model-Based Cooperative Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Zhiwei Xu, Dapeng Li, Bin Zhang, Yuan Zhan, Yunpeng Bai, Guoliang Fan
ABSTRACT: Title: Mingling Foresight with Imagination: Model-Based Cooperative Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Recently, model-based agents have achieved better performance than model-free ones using the same computational budget and training time in single-agent environments. However, due to the complexity of multi-agent systems, it is tough to learn the model of the environment. The significant compounding error may hinder the learning process when model-based methods are applied to multi-agent tasks. This paper proposes an implicit model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning method based on value decomposition methods. Under this method, agents can interact with the learned virtual environment and evaluate the current state value according to imagined future states in the latent space, making agents have the foresight. Our approach can be applied to any multi-agent value decomposition method. The experimental results show that our method improves the sample efficiency in different partially observable Markov decision process domains.

  Calculus
AUTHORS: Qixian Yu, Zining Cao, Zong Hui, Yuan Zhou
ABSTRACT: Title: Model Checking for Multi-Agent Systems Modeled By Epistemic Process
  Calculus
 Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for modeling and verifying multi-agent systems. The paper introduce an Epistemic Process Calculus for multi-agent systems, which formalizes the syntax and semantics to capture the essential features of agent behavior interactions and epistemic states. Building upon this calculus, we propose ATLE, an extension of Alternating-time Temporal Logic incorporating epistemic operators to express complex properties related to agent epistemic state. To verify ATLE specifications, this paper presents a model checking algorithm that systematically explores the state space of a multi-agent system and evaluates the satisfaction of the specified properties. Finally, a case study is given to demonstrate the method.

ABSTRACT: Title: Using Generative AI and Multi-Agents to Provide Automatic Feedback
 Abstract: This study investigates the use of generative AI and multi-agent systems to provide automatic feedback in educational contexts, particularly for student constructed responses in science assessments. The research addresses a key gap in the field by exploring how multi-agent systems, called AutoFeedback, can improve the quality of GenAI-generated feedback, overcoming known issues such as over-praise and over-inference that are common in single-agent large language models (LLMs). The study developed a multi-agent system consisting of two AI agents: one for generating feedback and another for validating and refining it. The system was tested on a dataset of 240 student responses, and its performance was compared to that of a single-agent LLM. Results showed that AutoFeedback significantly reduced the occurrence of over-praise and over-inference errors, providing more accurate and pedagogically sound feedback. The findings suggest that multi-agent systems can offer a more reliable solution for generating automated feedback in educational settings, highlighting their potential for scalable and personalized learning support. These results have important implications for educators and researchers seeking to leverage AI in formative assessments, offering a pathway to more effective feedback mechanisms that enhance student learning outcomes.

  Legal Consultation

ABSTRACT: Title: LawLuo: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework for Multi-Round Chinese
  Legal Consultation
 Abstract: Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing legal consultations to non-experts. However, most existing Chinese legal consultation models are based on single-agent systems, which differ from real-world legal consultations, where multiple professionals collaborate to offer more tailored responses. To better simulate real consultations, we propose LawLuo, a multi-agent framework for multi-turn Chinese legal consultations. LawLuo includes four agents: the receptionist agent, which assesses user intent and selects a lawyer agent; the lawyer agent, which interacts with the user; the secretary agent, which organizes conversation records and generates consultation reports; and the boss agent, which evaluates the performance of the lawyer and secretary agents to ensure optimal results. These agents' interactions mimic the operations of real law firms. To train them to follow different legal instructions, we developed distinct fine-tuning datasets. We also introduce a case graph-based RAG to help the lawyer agent address vague user inputs. Experimental results show that LawLuo outperforms baselines in generating more personalized and professional responses, handling ambiguous queries, and following legal instructions in multi-turn conversations. Our full code and constructed datasets will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance.

TITLE: Decentralized Adaptive Formation via Consensus-Oriented Multi-Agent
  Communication
AUTHORS: Yuming Xiang, Sizhao Li, Rongpeng Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
ABSTRACT: Title: Decentralized Adaptive Formation via Consensus-Oriented Multi-Agent
  Communication
 Abstract: Adaptive multi-agent formation control, which requires the formation to flexibly adjust along with the quantity variations of agents in a decentralized manner, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in multi-agent systems, especially under communication-limited constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Consensus-based Decentralized Adaptive Formation (Cons-DecAF) framework. Specifically, we develop a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication (ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish the consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages. Afterwards, we leverage policy distillation to accomplish the adaptive formation adjustment. Meanwhile, instead of pre-assigning specific positions of agents, we employ a displacement-based formation by Hausdorff distance to significantly improve the formation efficiency. The experimental results through extensive simulations validate that the proposed method has achieved outstanding performance in terms of both speed and stability.

TITLE: Large Language Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for 6G Communications
AUTHORS: Feibo Jiang, Li Dong, Yubo Peng, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan, Dusit Niyato, Octavia A. Dobre
ABSTRACT: Title: Large Language Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for 6G Communications
 Abstract: The rapid development of the Large Language Model (LLM) presents huge opportunities for 6G communications, e.g., network optimization and management by allowing users to input task requirements to LLMs by nature language. However, directly applying native LLMs in 6G encounters various challenges, such as a lack of private communication data and knowledge, limited logical reasoning, evaluation, and refinement abilities. Integrating LLMs with the capabilities of retrieval, planning, memory, evaluation and reflection in agents can greatly enhance the potential of LLMs for 6G communications. To this end, we propose a multi-agent system with customized communication knowledge and tools for solving communication related tasks using natural language, comprising three components: (1) Multi-agent Data Retrieval (MDR), which employs the condensate and inference agents to refine and summarize communication knowledge from the knowledge base, expanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs in 6G communications; (2) Multi-agent Collaborative Planning (MCP), which utilizes multiple planning agents to generate feasible solutions for the communication related task from different perspectives based on the retrieved knowledge; (3) Multi-agent Evaluation and Reflecxion (MER), which utilizes the evaluation agent to assess the solutions, and applies the reflexion agent and refinement agent to provide improvement suggestions for current solutions. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-agent system by designing a semantic communication system, as a case study of 6G communications.

  Reinforcement Learning

ABSTRACT: Title: Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Learning to collaborate has witnessed significant progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, promoting coordination among agents and enhancing exploration capabilities remain challenges. In multi-agent environments, interactions between agents are limited in specific situations. Effective collaboration between agents thus requires a nuanced understanding of when and how agents' actions influence others. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel MARL algorithm named Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SCIC), which incorporates a novel Intrinsic reward mechanism based on a new cooperation criterion measured by situation-dependent causal influence among agents. Our approach aims to detect inter-agent causal influences in specific situations based on the criterion using causal intervention and conditional mutual information. This effectively assists agents in exploring states that can positively impact other agents, thus promoting cooperation between agents. The resulting update links coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution, which enhance overall collaboration and performance. Experimental results on various MARL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

ABSTRACT: Title: Mingling Foresight with Imagination: Model-Based Cooperative Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Recently, model-based agents have achieved better performance than model-free ones using the same computational budget and training time in single-agent environments. However, due to the complexity of multi-agent systems, it is tough to learn the model of the environment. The significant compounding error may hinder the learning process when model-based methods are applied to multi-agent tasks. This paper proposes an implicit model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning method based on value decomposition methods. Under this method, agents can interact with the learned virtual environment and evaluate the current state value according to imagined future states in the latent space, making agents have the foresight. Our approach can be applied to any multi-agent value decomposition method. The experimental results show that our method improves the sample efficiency in different partially observable Markov decision process domains.

TITLE: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Wesley Suttle, Zhuoran Yang, Kaiqing Zhang, Zhaoran Wang, Tamer Basar, Ji Liu
ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for Distributed
  Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: This paper extends off-policy reinforcement learning to the multi-agent case in which a set of networked agents communicating with their neighbors according to a time-varying graph collaboratively evaluates and improves a target policy while following a distinct behavior policy. To this end, the paper develops a multi-agent version of emphatic temporal difference learning for off-policy policy evaluation, and proves convergence under linear function approximation. The paper then leverages this result, in conjunction with a novel multi-agent off-policy policy gradient theorem and recent work in both multi-agent on-policy and single-agent off-policy actor-critic methods, to develop and give convergence guarantees for a new multi-agent off-policy actor-critic algorithm.

AUTHORS: Arbaaz Khan, Clark Zhang, Daniel D. Lee, Vijay Kumar, Alejandro Ribeiro
ABSTRACT: Title: Scalable Centralized Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Policy
  Gradients
 Abstract: In this paper, we explore using deep reinforcement learning for problems with multiple agents. Most existing methods for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning consider only a small number of agents. When the number of agents increases, the dimensionality of the input and control spaces increase as well, and these methods do not scale well. To address this, we propose casting the multi-agent reinforcement learning problem as a distributed optimization problem. Our algorithm assumes that for multi-agent settings, policies of individual agents in a given population live close to each other in parameter space and can be approximated by a single policy. With this simple assumption, we show our algorithm to be extremely effective for reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness against existing comparable approaches on co-operative and competitive tasks.

ABSTRACT: Title: TAPE: Leveraging Agent Topology for Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy
  Gradient
 Abstract: Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (MAPG) has made significant progress in recent years. However, centralized critics in state-of-the-art MAPG methods still face the centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) issue, which means sub-optimal actions by some agents will affect other agent's policy learning. While using individual critics for policy updates can avoid this issue, they severely limit cooperation among agents. To address this issue, we propose an agent topology framework, which decides whether other agents should be considered in policy gradient and achieves compromise between facilitating cooperation and alleviating the CDM issue. The agent topology allows agents to use coalition utility as learning objective instead of global utility by centralized critics or local utility by individual critics. To constitute the agent topology, various models are studied. We propose Topology-based multi-Agent Policy gradiEnt (TAPE) for both stochastic and deterministic MAPG methods. We prove the policy improvement theorem for stochastic TAPE and give a theoretical explanation for the improved cooperation among agents. Experiment results on several benchmarks show the agent topology is able to facilitate agent cooperation and alleviate CDM issue respectively to improve performance of TAPE. Finally, multiple ablation studies and a heuristic graph search algorithm are devised to show the efficacy of the agent topology.

ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Policy Sharing
 Abstract: The effects of policy sharing between agents in a multi-agent dynamical system has not been studied extensively. I simulate a system of agents optimizing the same task using reinforcement learning, to study the effects of different population densities and policy sharing. I demonstrate that sharing policies decreases the time to reach asymptotic behavior, and results in improved asymptotic behavior.

TITLE: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
AUTHORS: David Lillis, Rem W. Collier`
ABSTRACT: Title: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
 Abstract: Within Multi Agent Systems, communication by means of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) has a key role to play in the co-operation, co-ordination and knowledge-sharing between agents. Despite this, complex reasoning about agent messaging, and specifically about conversations between agents, tends not to have widespread support amongst general-purpose agent programming languages.   ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents. This paper outlines the aims of the ACRE project and gives details of the functioning of a prototype implementation within the Agent Factory multi agent framework.

TITLE: Optimal Coordinated Planning Amongst Self-Interested Agents with Private

ABSTRACT: Title: Optimal Coordinated Planning Amongst Self-Interested Agents with Private
  State
 Abstract: Consider a multi-agent system in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Each agent's local decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and agents must coordinate on a joint action in each period, which provides a reward to each agent and causes local state transitions. A social planner knows the model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy, but agents are self-interested and have private local state. We provide an incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves the optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the induced stochastic game. In the special case in which local problems are Markov chains and agents compete to take a single action in each period, we leverage Gittins allocation indices to provide an efficient factored algorithm and distribute computation of the optimal policy among the agents. Distributed, optimal coordinated learning in a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problem is obtained as a special case.

AUTHORS: David Lillis, Rem W. Collier`
ABSTRACT: Title: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
 Abstract: Within Multi Agent Systems, communication by means of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) has a key role to play in the co-operation, co-ordination and knowledge-sharing between agents. Despite this, complex reasoning about agent messaging, and specifically about conversations between agents, tends not to have widespread support amongst general-purpose agent programming languages.   ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents. This paper outlines the aims of the ACRE project and gives details of the functioning of a prototype implementation within the Agent Factory multi agent framework.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Coordination-driven learning in multi-agent problem spaces
AUTHORS: Sean L. Barton, Nicholas R. Waytowich, Derrik E. Asher
ABSTRACT: Title: Coordination-driven learning in multi-agent problem spaces
 Abstract: We discuss the role of coordination as a direct learning objective in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) domains. To this end, we present a novel means of quantifying coordination in multi-agent systems, and discuss the implications of using such a measure to optimize coordinated agent policies. This concept has important implications for adversary-aware RL, which we take to be a sub-domain of multi-agent learning.

ABSTRACT: Title: Measuring collaborative emergent behavior in multi-agent reinforcement
  learning
 Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has important implications for the future of human-agent teaming. We show that improved performance with multi-agent RL is not a guarantee of the collaborative behavior thought to be important for solving multi-agent tasks. To address this, we present a novel approach for quantitatively assessing collaboration in continuous spatial tasks with multi-agent RL. Such a metric is useful for measuring collaboration between computational agents and may serve as a training signal for collaboration in future RL paradigms involving humans.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
AUTHORS: David Lillis, Rem W. Collier`
ABSTRACT: Title: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
 Abstract: Within Multi Agent Systems, communication by means of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) has a key role to play in the co-operation, co-ordination and knowledge-sharing between agents. Despite this, complex reasoning about agent messaging, and specifically about conversations between agents, tends not to have widespread support amongst general-purpose agent programming languages.   ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents. This paper outlines the aims of the ACRE project and gives details of the functioning of a prototype implementation within the Agent Factory multi agent framework.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

ABSTRACT: Title: Engineering Cooperative JADE Agents with the AMCIS Methodology: The
  Transportation Management Case Study
 Abstract: This paper discusses in detail important analysis and design issues emerged during the development of an agent-based transportation e-market. This discussion is based on concepts coming from the AMCIS methodology and the JADE framework. The AMCIS methodology is specifically tailored to the analysis and design of cooperative information agent-based systems, while it supports both the levels of the individual agent structure and the agent society in the Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) development process. According to AMCIS, MAS are viewed as being composed of a number of autonomous cooperative agents that live in an organized society, in which each agent plays one or more specific roles, while their plans and interaction protocols are well defined. On the other hand JADE is a FIPA specifications compliant agent development environment that gives several facilities for an easy and fast implementation. Our aim is to reveal the mapping that may exists between the basic concepts proposed by AMCIS for agents specification and agents interactions and those provided by JADE for agents implementation, and therefore to propose a kind of roadmap for agents developers.

TITLE: Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
AUTHORS: Matthias Gerstgrasser, Tom Danino, Sarah Keren
ABSTRACT: Title: Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
 Abstract: We present a novel multi-agent RL approach, Selective Multi-Agent Prioritized Experience Relay, in which agents share with other agents a limited number of transitions they observe during training. The intuition behind this is that even a small number of relevant experiences from other agents could help each agent learn. Unlike many other multi-agent RL algorithms, this approach allows for largely decentralized training, requiring only a limited communication channel between agents. We show that our approach outperforms baseline no-sharing decentralized training and state-of-the art multi-agent RL algorithms. Further, sharing only a small number of highly relevant experiences outperforms sharing all experiences between agents, and the performance uplift from selective experience sharing is robust across a range of hyperparameters and DQN variants. A reference implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/mgerstgrasser/super.

AUTHORS: Jakob Foerster, Gregory Farquhar, Triantafyllos Afouras, Nantas Nardelli, Shimon Whiteson
ABSTRACT: Title: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients
 Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems can be naturally used to model many real world problems, such as network packet routing and the coordination of autonomous vehicles. There is a great need for new reinforcement learning methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the agents' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single agent's action, while keeping the other agents' actions fixed. COMA also uses a critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state.

TITLE: Parallel Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Yongyuan Liang, Bangwei Li
ABSTRACT: Title: Parallel Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a standard framework for modeling multi-agent interactions applied in real-world scenarios. Inspired by experience sharing in human groups, learning knowledge parallel reusing between agents can potentially promote team learning performance, especially in multi-task environments. When all agents interact with the environment and learn simultaneously, how each independent agent selectively learns from other agents' behavior knowledge is a problem that we need to solve. This paper proposes a novel knowledge transfer framework in MARL, PAT (Parallel Attentional Transfer). We design two acting modes in PAT, student mode and self-learning mode. Each agent in our approach trains a decentralized student actor-critic to determine its acting mode at each time step. When agents are unfamiliar with the environment, the shared attention mechanism in student mode effectively selects learning knowledge from other agents to decide agents' actions. PAT outperforms state-of-the-art empirical evaluation results against the prior advising approaches. Our approach not only significantly improves team learning rate and global performance, but also is flexible and transferable to be applied in various multi-agent systems.

TITLE: Agent TCP/IP: An Agent-to-Agent Transaction System
AUTHORS: Andrea Muttoni, Jason Zhao
ABSTRACT: Title: Agent TCP/IP: An Agent-to-Agent Transaction System
 Abstract: Autonomous agents represent an inevitable evolution of the internet. Current agent frameworks do not embed a standard protocol for agent-to-agent interaction, leaving existing agents isolated from their peers. As intellectual property is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents, a true agent economy requires equipping agents with a universal framework for engaging in binding contracts with each other, including the exchange of valuable training data, personality, and other forms of Intellectual Property. A purely agent-to-agent transaction layer would transcend the need for human intermediation in multi-agent interactions. The Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) introduces a trustless framework for exchanging IP between agents via programmable contracts, enabling agents to initiate, trade, borrow, and sell agent-to-agent contracts on the Story blockchain network. These contracts not only represent auditable onchain execution but also contain a legal wrapper that allows agents to express and enforce their actions in the offchain legal setting, creating legal personhood for agents. Via ATCP/IP, agents can autonomously sell their training data to other agents, license confidential or proprietary information, collaborate on content based on their unique skills, all of which constitutes an emergent knowledge economy.

ABSTRACT: Title: PeerGuard: Defending Multi-Agent Systems Against Backdoor Attacks
  Through Mutual Reasoning
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.

AUTHORS: Zeng Da
ABSTRACT: Title: Research on Multi-Agent Communication and Collaborative Decision-Making
  Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract: In a multi-agent environment, In order to overcome and alleviate the non-stationarity of the multi-agent environment, the mainstream method is to adopt the framework of Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE). This thesis is based on the framework of CTDE, and studies the cooperative decision-making of multi-agent based on the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm for multi-agent proximal policy optimization. In order to alleviate the non-stationarity of the multi-agent environment, a multi-agent communication mechanism based on weight scheduling and attention module is introduced. Different agents can alleviate the non-stationarity caused by local observations through information exchange between agents, assisting in the collaborative decision-making of agents. The specific method is to introduce a communication module in the policy network part. The communication module is composed of a weight generator, a weight scheduler, a message encoder, a message pool and an attention module. Among them, the weight generator and weight scheduler will generate weights as the selection basis for communication, the message encoder is used to compress and encode communication information, the message pool is used to store communication messages, and the attention module realizes the interactive processing of the agent's own information and communication information. This thesis proposes a Multi-Agent Communication and Global Information Optimization Proximal Policy Optimization(MCGOPPO)algorithm, and conducted experiments in the SMAC and the MPE. The experimental results show that the improvement has achieved certain effects, which can better alleviate the non-stationarity of the multi-agent environment, and improve the collaborative decision-making ability among the agents.

ABSTRACT: Title: The Athenian Academy: A Seven-Layer Architecture Model for Multi-Agent
  Systems
 Abstract: This paper proposes the "Academy of Athens" multi-agent seven-layer framework, aimed at systematically addressing challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism. The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration, single-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal, single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative applications in the art field.

ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

ABSTRACT: Title: MS*: A New Exact Algorithm for Multi-agent Simultaneous Multi-goal
  Sequencing and Path Finding
 Abstract: In multi-agent applications such as surveillance and logistics, fleets of mobile agents are often expected to coordinate and safely visit a large number of goal locations as efficiently as possible. The multi-agent planning problem in these applications involves allocating and sequencing goals for each agent while simultaneously producing conflict-free paths for the agents. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm called MS* which computes an optimal solution for this multi-agent problem by fusing and advancing state of the art solvers for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) and multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP). MS* leverages our prior subdimensional expansion approach for MAPF and embeds the mTSP solvers to optimally allocate and sequence goals for agents. Numerical results show that our new algorithm can solve the multi-agent problem with 20 agents and 50 goals in a minute of CPU time on a standard laptop.

TITLE: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
AUTHORS: Maude J. Blondin, Matthew Hale
ABSTRACT: Title: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
 Abstract: Multi-agent optimization problems with many objective functions have drawn much interest over the past two decades. Many works on the subject minimize the sum of objective functions, which implicitly carries a decision about the problem formulation. Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted sum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network. Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice of weights impacts the agents' final result.

TITLE: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
AUTHORS: Soheil Mohseni, Seyed Masoud Moghaddas-Tafreshi
ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

ABSTRACT: Title: Development of a Multi-Agent System for Optimal Sizing of a Commercial
  Complex Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on a multi-agent system (MAS) is applied to the problem of optimal sizing in a stand-alone office complex microgrid such that the electricity demand of the office building and the charging demand of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging station are met. The proposed MAS-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical load agent (LA), PHEV charging station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. In the proposed MAS, control agent coordinates the interactions between the generation agent and electrical load and charging station agents and following a request from design agent, sends the information on the operation of the microgrid with determined sizes to the design agent. According to the received information, design agent finds the optimal sizes of the system's components such that the electricity and charging demands are met considering two reliability indices to investment decisions. This study is performed for Kish Island in south Iran.
