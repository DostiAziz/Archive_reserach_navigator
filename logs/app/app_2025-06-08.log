Abstract: We consider vertex decompositions of (di)graphs which appear in Automata Theory, and establish some their properties. Then we apply them to the problem of forbidden subgraphs.

Content: Title: On some power sum problems of Montgomery and Turan
Abstract: We use an estimate for character sums over finite fields of Katz to solve open problems of Montgomery and Turan. Let h=>2 be an integer. We prove that inf_{|z_k| => 1} max_{v=1,...,n^h} |sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v| <= (h-1+o(1)) sqrt n. This gives the right order of magnitude for the quantity and improves on a bound of Erdos-Renyi by a factor of the order sqrt log n.

Content: Title: Daisies and Other Turan Problems
Abstract: We make some conjectures about extremal densities of daisy-free families, where a `daisy' is a certain hypergraph. These questions turn out to be related to some Turan problems in the hypercube, but they are also natural in their own right.

Content: Title: Some exact results for regular Turán problems
Abstract: As a variant of the famous Tur\'an problem, we study $\mathrm{rex}(n,F)$, the maximum number of edges that an $n$-vertex regular graph can have without containing a copy of $F$. We determine $\mathrm{rex}(n,K_{r+1})$ for all pairs of integers $r$ and large enough $n$. For every tree $T$, we determine $\mathrm{rex}(n,T)$ for every $n$ large enough.

Content: Title: Turán numbers of extensions
Abstract: The extension of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is obtained from it by adding for every pair of vertices of $G$, which is not covered by an edge in $G$, an extra edge containing this pair and $r-2$ new vertices. Keevash and Sidorenko~ have previously determined Tur\'an densities of two families of hypergraph extensions. We determine the Tur\'an numbers for these families, using classical stability techniques and new tools introduced in our earlier paper.

Content: Title: Generalized regular Turán numbers
Abstract: We combine two generalizations of ordinary Tur\'an problems. Given graphs $H$ and $F$ and a positive integer $n$, we study $rex(n, H, F )$, which is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $F$-free regular $n$-vertex graphs.

Content: Title: Multipliers of grand and small Lebesgue spaces
Abstract: Let $G$ a locally compact abelian group with Haar measure $\mu$ and let $1<p<\infty. $ In the present paper we determine necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$ for the grand Lebesgue space $ L^{p),\theta}(G)$ to be a Banach algebra under convolution.Later we characterize the multipliers of the grand Lebesgues, $L^{p,)\theta}(G)$ and the small Lebesgue spaces $L^{(P'\theta}$, where $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1$

Content: Title: Turan numbers of extensions of some sparse hypergraphs via Lagrangians
Abstract: Given a positive integer $n$ and an $r$-uniform hypergraph (or $r$-graph for short) $F$, the Turan number $ex(n,F)$ of $F$ is the maximum number of edges in an $r$-graph on $n$ vertices that does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. The extension $H^F $ of $F$ is obtained as follows: For each pair of vertices $v_i,v_j$ in $F$ not contained in an edge of $F$, we add a set $B_{ij}$ of $r-2$ new vertices and the edge $\{v_i,v_j\} \cup B_{ij}$, where the $B_{ij}$ 's are pairwise disjoint over all such pairs $\{i,j\}$. Let $K^r_p$ denote the complete $r$-graph on $p$ vertices. For all sufficiently large $n$, we determine the Turan numbers of the extensions of a $3$-uniform $t$-matching, a $3$-uniform linear star of size $t$, and a $4$-uniform linear star of size $t$, respectively. We also show that the unique extremal hypergraphs are balanced blowups of $K^3_{3t-1}, K^3_{2t}$, and $K^4_{3t}$, respectively. Our results generalize the recent result of Hefetz and Keevash [7].

Content: Title: The Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the
  hypercube Q_n
Abstract: The n-dimensional hypercube Q_n is a graph with vertex set {0,1}^n such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3) for all n >= 3.

Content: Title: On some power sum problems of Montgomery and Turan
Abstract: We use an estimate for character sums over finite fields of Katz to solve open problems of Montgomery and Turan. Let h=>2 be an integer. We prove that inf_{|z_k| => 1} max_{v=1,...,n^h} |sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v| <= (h-1+o(1)) sqrt n. This gives the right order of magnitude for the quantity and improves on a bound of Erdos-Renyi by a factor of the order sqrt log n.

Abstract: We make some conjectures about extremal densities of daisy-free families, where a `daisy' is a certain hypergraph. These questions turn out to be related to some Turan problems in the hypercube, but they are also natural in their own right.

TITLE: New lower bounds for the Turán density of $PG_{m}(q)$
AUTHORS: Tao Zhang, Gennian Ge
ABSTRACT: No abstract available
CONTENT: Title: New lower bounds for the Turán density of $PG_{m}(q)$
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph. The Tur\'{a}n number $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{H})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph. The Tur\'{a}n density of $\mathcal{H}$ is defined by \[\pi(\mathcal{H})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{H})}{\binom{n}{r}}.\] In this paper, we consider the Tur\'{a}n density of projective geometries. We give two new constructions of $PG_{m}(q)$-free hypergraphs which improve some results given by Keevash (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 111: 289--309, 2005). Based on an upper bound of blocking sets of $PG_m(q)$, we give a new general lower bound for the Tur\'{a}n density of $PG_{m}(q)$. By a detailed analysis of the structures of complete arcs in $PG_2(q)$, we also get better lower bounds for the Tur\'{a}n density of $PG_2(q)$ with $q=3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 7,\ 8$.

Abstract: Let $m\leq n$ be positive integers and $\mathfrak X$ a class of groups which is closed for subgroups, quotient groups and extensions. Suppose that a finite group $G$ satisfies the condition that for every two subsets $M$ and $N$ of cardinalities $m$ and $n,$ respectively, there exist $x \in M$ and $y \in N$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle\in \mathfrak X.$ Then either $G\in \mathfrak X$ or $|G|\leq \left(\frac{180}{53}\right)^m(n-1).$

ABSTRACT: No abstract available
CONTENT: Title: Turan's problem 10 revisited
Abstract: In this paper we prove that inf_{|z_k| => 1} max_{v=1,...,n^2} |sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v| = sqrt n+O(n^{0.2625+epsilon}). This improves on the bound O(sqrt (n log n)) of Erdos and Renyi. In the special case of $n+1$ being a prime we have previously proved the much sharper result that the quantity lies in the interval [sqrt(n),sqrt(n+1)] The method of proof combines a general lower bound (of Andersson), explicit arithmetical constructions (of Montgomery, Fabrykowski or Andersson), moments (probabilistic methods) and estimates for the difference of consecutive primes (of Baker, Harman and Pintz). We also prove some (conditional and unconditional) related results.

TITLE: Generalized Turán problem for Complete Hypergraphs

ABSTRACT: No abstract available
CONTENT: Title: Generalized Turán problem for Complete Hypergraphs
Abstract: Write $K^{(k)}_{n}$ for the complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices. For $2 \leq k \leq g < r$ integers, let $\pi\left(n, K^{(k)}_{g}, K^{(k)}_r\right)$ be the maximum density of $K^{(k)}_{g}$ in $n$ vertex $K^{(k)}_{r}$-free $k$-graphs. The main contribution of this paper is the upper bound: $\pi\left(n, K^{(k)}_{g}, K^{(k)}_r\right) \leq \left(1 + O\left(n^{-1}\right) \right)\prod_{m=k}^{g} \left(1 - \frac{\binom{m-1}{k-1}}{\binom{r-1}{k-1}} \right).$ The graph case ($k=2$) is the first known generalized Tur\'an question, investigated by Erd\H{o}s. The $k=g$ case is the hypergraph Tur\'an problem where the best known general upper bound is by de Caen. The result proved here matches both bounds asymptotically, while any triple $k, g, r$ with $2 < k < g < r$ provides a new upper bound. The proof uses techniques from the theory of flag algebras to derive linear relations between different densities. These relations can be combined with linear algebraic methods. Additionally a simple flag algebraic certificate will be given for $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \pi \left(n, K^{(3)}_4, K^{(3)}_5 \right) = 3/8$.

ABSTRACT: No abstract available
CONTENT: Title: Dimension and randomness in groups acting on rooted trees
Abstract: We explore the structure of the p-adic automorphism group Gamma of the infinite rooted regular tree. We determine the asymptotic order of a typical element, answering an old question of Turan.   We initiate the study of a general dimension theory of groups acting on rooted trees. We describe the relationship between dimension and other properties of groups such as solvability, existence of dense free subgroups and the normal subgroup structure. We show that subgroups of Gamma generated by three random elements are full-dimensional and that there exist finitely generated subgroups of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, our results solve an open problem of Shalev and answer a question of Sidki.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Sidorenko Hypergraphs and Random Turán Numbers
AUTHORS: Jiaxi Nie, Sam Spiro
ABSTRACT: Let $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ denote the maximum number of edges in an $F$-free subgraph of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$. Building on recent work of Conlon, Lee, and Sidorenko, we prove non-trivial lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ whenever $F$ is not Sidorenko. This connection between Sidorenko's conjecture and random Tur\'an problems gives new lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ whenever $F$ is not Sidorenko, and further allows us to bound how "far" from Sidorenko an $r$-graph $F$ is whenever upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ are known.

TITLE: Stability results on vertex Turán problems in Kneser graphs
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner, Abhishek Methuku, Dániel Nagy, Balázs Patkós, Máté Vizer
ABSTRACT: The vertex set of the Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ is $V = \binom{[n]}{k}$ and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding sets are disjoint. For any graph $F$, the largest size of a vertex set $U \subseteq V$ such that $K(n,k)[U]$ is $F$-free, was recently determined by Alishahi and Taherkhani, whenever $n$ is large enough compared to $k$ and $F$. In this paper, we determine the second largest size of a vertex set $W \subseteq V$ such that $K(n,k)[W]$ is $F$-free, in the case when $F$ is an even cycle or a complete multi-partite graph. In the latter case, we actually give a more general theorem depending on the chromatic number of $F$. These results generalize the celebrated Erd\H os-Ko-Rado theorem and Hilton-Milner theorem.

TITLE: The Turán number of book graphs
AUTHORS: Jingru Yan, Xingzhi Zhan
ABSTRACT: Given a graph $H$ and a positive integer $n,$ the Tur\'{a}n number of $H$ for the order $n,$ denoted ${\rm ex}(n,H),$ is the maximum size of a simple graph of order $n$ not containing $H$ as a subgraph. The book with $p$ pages, denoted $B_p$, is the graph that consists of $p$ triangles sharing a common edge. Bollob\'{a}s and Erd\H{o}s initiated the research on the Tur\'{a}n number of book graphs in 1975. The two numbers ${\rm ex}(p+2,B_p)$ and ${\rm ex}(p+3,B_p)$ have been determined by Qiao and Zhan. In this paper we determine the numbers ${\rm ex}(p+4,B_p),$ ${\rm ex}(p+5,B_p)$ and ${\rm ex}(p+6,B_p),$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs for the numbers ${\rm ex}(n,B_p)$ with $n=p+2,\,p+3,\,p+4,\,p+5.$

TITLE: Generalized Turán problem for Complete Hypergraphs
AUTHORS: Levente Bodnar
ABSTRACT: Write $K^{(k)}_{n}$ for the complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices. For $2 \leq k \leq g < r$ integers, let $\pi\left(n, K^{(k)}_{g}, K^{(k)}_r\right)$ be the maximum density of $K^{(k)}_{g}$ in $n$ vertex $K^{(k)}_{r}$-free $k$-graphs. The main contribution of this paper is the upper bound: $\pi\left(n, K^{(k)}_{g}, K^{(k)}_r\right) \leq \left(1 + O\left(n^{-1}\right) \right)\prod_{m=k}^{g} \left(1 - \frac{\binom{m-1}{k-1}}{\binom{r-1}{k-1}} \right).$ The graph case ($k=2$) is the first known generalized Tur\'an question, investigated by Erd\H{o}s. The $k=g$ case is the hypergraph Tur\'an problem where the best known general upper bound is by de Caen. The result proved here matches both bounds asymptotically, while any triple $k, g, r$ with $2 < k < g < r$ provides a new upper bound. The proof uses techniques from the theory of flag algebras to derive linear relations between different densities. These relations can be combined with linear algebraic methods. Additionally a simple flag algebraic certificate will be given for $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \pi \left(n, K^{(3)}_4, K^{(3)}_5 \right) = 3/8$.

TITLE: Turan numbers of extensions of some sparse hypergraphs via Lagrangians
AUTHORS: Tao Jiang, Yuejian Peng, Biao Wu
ABSTRACT: Given a positive integer $n$ and an $r$-uniform hypergraph (or $r$-graph for short) $F$, the Turan number $ex(n,F)$ of $F$ is the maximum number of edges in an $r$-graph on $n$ vertices that does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. The extension $H^F $ of $F$ is obtained as follows: For each pair of vertices $v_i,v_j$ in $F$ not contained in an edge of $F$, we add a set $B_{ij}$ of $r-2$ new vertices and the edge $\{v_i,v_j\} \cup B_{ij}$, where the $B_{ij}$ 's are pairwise disjoint over all such pairs $\{i,j\}$. Let $K^r_p$ denote the complete $r$-graph on $p$ vertices. For all sufficiently large $n$, we determine the Turan numbers of the extensions of a $3$-uniform $t$-matching, a $3$-uniform linear star of size $t$, and a $4$-uniform linear star of size $t$, respectively. We also show that the unique extremal hypergraphs are balanced blowups of $K^3_{3t-1}, K^3_{2t}$, and $K^4_{3t}$, respectively. Our results generalize the recent result of Hefetz and Keevash [7].

ABSTRACT: Turan's theorem implies that every graph of order n with more edges than the r-partite Turan graph contains a complete graph of order r+1. We show that the same premise implies the existence of much larger graphs. We also prove corresponding stability theorems. These results complete work started by Erdos in 1963.

TITLE: Turán numbers of extensions
AUTHORS: Sergey Norin, Liana Yepremyan
ABSTRACT: The extension of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is obtained from it by adding for every pair of vertices of $G$, which is not covered by an edge in $G$, an extra edge containing this pair and $r-2$ new vertices. Keevash and Sidorenko~ have previously determined Tur\'an densities of two families of hypergraph extensions. We determine the Tur\'an numbers for these families, using classical stability techniques and new tools introduced in our earlier paper.

TITLE: Turán's Theorem for random graphs
AUTHORS: Bobby DeMarco, Jeff Kahn
ABSTRACT: For a graph $G$, denote by $t_r(G)$ (resp. $b_r(G)$) the maximum size of a $K_r$-free (resp. $(r-1)$-partite) subgraph of $G$. Of course $t_r(G) \geq b_r(G)$ for any $G$, and Tur\'an's Theorem says that equality holds for complete graphs. With $G_{n,p}$ the usual ("binomial" or "Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi") random graph, we show:   For each fixed r there is a C such that if \[ p=p(n) > Cn^{-\tfrac{2}{r+1}}\log^{\tfrac{2}{(r+1)(r-2)}}n, \] then $\Pr(t_r(G_{n,p})=b_r(G_{n,p}))\rightarrow 1$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.   This is best possible (apart from the value of $C$) and settles a question first considered by Babai, Simonovits and Spencer about 25 years ago.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: On local Turán problems
AUTHORS: Peter Frankl, Hao Huang, Vojtěch Rödl
ABSTRACT: Since its formulation, Tur\'an's hypergraph problems have been among the most challenging open problems in extremal combinatorics. One of them is the following: given a $3$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$ on $n$ vertices in which any five vertices span at least one edge, prove that $|\mathcal{F}| \ge (1/4 -o(1))\binom{n}{3}$. The construction showing that this bound would be best possible is simply $\binom{X}{3} \cup \binom{Y}{3}$ where $X$ and $Y$ evenly partition the vertex set. This construction has the following more general $(2p+1, p+1)$-property: any set of $2p+1$ vertices spans a complete sub-hypergraph on $p+1$ vertices. One of our main results says that, quite surprisingly, for all $p>2$ the $(2p+1,p+1)$-property implies the conjectured lower bound.

TITLE: The Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the
  hypercube Q_n
AUTHORS: Shoujun Xu, Dandan Liu
ABSTRACT: The n-dimensional hypercube Q_n is a graph with vertex set {0,1}^n such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3) for all n >= 3.

We prove that inf_{|z_k| => 1} max_{v=1,...,n^h} |sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v| <= (h-1+o(1)) sqrt n. This gives the right order of magnitude for the quantity and improves on a bound of Erdos-Renyi by a factor of the order sqrt log n.

ABSTRACT: Let $m\leq n$ be positive integers and $\mathfrak X$ a class of groups which is closed for subgroups, quotient groups and extensions. Suppose that a finite group $G$ satisfies the condition that for every two subsets $M$ and $N$ of cardinalities $m$ and $n,$ respectively, there exist $x \in M$ and $y \in N$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle\in \mathfrak X.$ Then either $G\in \mathfrak X$ or $|G|\leq \left(\frac{180}{53}\right)^m(n-1).$

TITLE: The Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the
  hypercube Q_n
AUTHORS: Shoujun Xu, Dandan Liu
ABSTRACT: The n-dimensional hypercube Q_n is a graph with vertex set {0,1}^n such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3) for all n >= 3.

TITLE: Dimension and randomness in groups acting on rooted trees
AUTHORS: Miklos Abert, Balint Virag
ABSTRACT: We explore the structure of the p-adic automorphism group Gamma of the infinite rooted regular tree. We determine the asymptotic order of a typical element, answering an old question of Turan.   We initiate the study of a general dimension theory of groups acting on rooted trees. We describe the relationship between dimension and other properties of groups such as solvability, existence of dense free subgroups and the normal subgroup structure. We show that subgroups of Gamma generated by three random elements are full-dimensional and that there exist finitely generated subgroups of arbitrary dimension. Specifically, our results solve an open problem of Shalev and answer a question of Sidki.

TITLE: Turan's problem 10 revisited
AUTHORS: Johan Andersson
ABSTRACT: In this paper we prove that inf_{|z_k| => 1} max_{v=1,...,n^2} |sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v| = sqrt n+O(n^{0.2625+epsilon}). This improves on the bound O(sqrt (n log n)) of Erdos and Renyi. In the special case of $n+1$ being a prime we have previously proved the much sharper result that the quantity lies in the interval [sqrt(n),sqrt(n+1)] The method of proof combines a general lower bound (of Andersson), explicit arithmetical constructions (of Montgomery, Fabrykowski or Andersson), moments (probabilistic methods) and estimates for the difference of consecutive primes (of Baker, Harman and Pintz). We also prove some (conditional and unconditional) related results.

TITLE: A note on the Turán number of a Berge odd cycle

ABSTRACT: In this note we obtain upper bounds on the number of hyperedges in 3-uniform hypergraphs not containing a Berge cycle of given odd length. We improve the bound given by F\"uredi and \"Ozkahya in 2017. The result follows from a more general theorem. We also obtain some new results for Berge cliques.

[PAPER 2]
TITLE: Soft Locality Preserving Map (SLPM) for Facial Expression Recognition
AUTHORS: Cigdem Turan, Kin-Man Lam, Xiangjian He
ABSTRACT: For image recognition, an extensive number of methods have been proposed to overcome the high-dimensionality problem of feature vectors being used. These methods vary from unsupervised to supervised, and from statistics to graph-theory based. In this paper, the most popular and the state-of-the-art methods for dimensionality reduction are firstly reviewed, and then a new and more efficient manifold-learning method, named Soft Locality Preserving Map (SLPM), is presented. Furthermore, feature generation and sample selection are proposed to achieve better manifold learning. SLPM is a graph-based subspace-learning method, with the use of k-neighbourhood information and the class information. The key feature of SLPM is that it aims to control the level of spread of the different classes, because the spread of the classes in the underlying manifold is closely connected to the generalizability of the learned subspace. Our proposed manifold-learning method can be applied to various pattern recognition applications, and we evaluate its performances on facial expression recognition. Experiments on databases, such as the Bahcesehir University Multilingual Affective Face Database (BAUM-2), the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) Database, the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database, and the Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database (TFEID), show that SLPM can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and enhance the discriminative power of the extracted features for expression recognition. Furthermore, the proposed feature-generation method can improve the generalizability of the underlying manifolds for facial expression recognition.

TITLE: Robust Distributed Optimization With Randomly Corrupted Gradients
AUTHORS: Berkay Turan, Cesar A. Uribe, Hoi-To Wai, Mahnoosh Alizadeh
ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a first-order distributed optimization algorithm that is provably robust to Byzantine failures-arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior, where all the participating agents are prone to failure. We model each agent's state over time as a two-state Markov chain that indicates Byzantine or trustworthy behaviors at different time instants. We set no restrictions on the maximum number of Byzantine agents at any given time. We design our method based on three layers of defense: 1) temporal robust aggregation, 2) spatial robust aggregation, and 3) gradient normalization. We study two settings for stochastic optimization, namely Sample Average Approximation and Stochastic Approximation. We provide convergence guarantees of our method for strongly convex and smooth non-convex cost functions.

[PAPER 4]
TITLE: Learning a convex cost-to-go for single step model predictive control
AUTHORS: E. M. Turan, Z. Mdoe, J. Jäschke
ABSTRACT: For large uncertain systems, solving model predictive control problems online can be computationally taxing. Using a shorter prediction horizon can help, but may lead to poor performance and instability without appropriate modifications. This work focuses on learning convex objective terms to enable a single-step control horizon, reducing online computational costs. We consider two surrogates for approximating the cost-to-go: (1) a convex interpolating function and (2) an input-convex neural network. Regardless of the surrogate choice, its behavior near the origin and its ability to describe the feasible region are crucial for the closed-loop performance of the new MPC problem. We address this by tailoring the surrogate to ensure good performance in both aspects. We conclude with numerical examples, in which we compare the convex surrogates to using a standard neural network in the objective, solely using an LQR cost-to-go, and to using a neural network to learn a control policy. The proposed approaches are shown to achieve better performance with less data.

TITLE: Learning The MMSE Channel Predictor
AUTHORS: Nurettin Turan, Wolfgang Utschick
ABSTRACT: We present a neural network based predictor which is derived by starting from the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) predictor and by further making two key assumptions. With these assumptions, we first derive a weighted sum of LMMSE predictors which is motivated by the structure of the optimal MMSE predictor. This predictor provides an initialization (weight matrices, biases and activation function) to a feed-forward neural network based predictor. With a properly learned neural network, we show that under the given channel model assumptions it is possible to easily outperform the LMMSE predictor based on the Jakes assumption of the underlying Doppler spectrum.

TITLE: Some stability and exact results in generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Stability refers to the usual phenomenon that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains almost $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$, than $G$ is in some sense similar to some extremal graph. We obtain new stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems and derive several new exact results.

Our result in particular generates infinitely many new Tur\'an exponents. As a byproduct, we formulate a framework that is taking shape in recent work on the Bukh--Conlon conjecture.

ABSTRACT: Turan's theorem implies that every graph of order n with more edges than the r-partite Turan graph contains a complete graph of order r+1. We show that the same premise implies the existence of much larger graphs. We also prove corresponding stability theorems. These results complete work started by Erdos in 1963.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Turán's Theorem for random graphs
AUTHORS: Bobby DeMarco, Jeff Kahn
ABSTRACT: For a graph $G$, denote by $t_r(G)$ (resp. $b_r(G)$) the maximum size of a $K_r$-free (resp. $(r-1)$-partite) subgraph of $G$. Of course $t_r(G) \geq b_r(G)$ for any $G$, and Tur\'an's Theorem says that equality holds for complete graphs. With $G_{n,p}$ the usual ("binomial" or "Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi") random graph, we show:   For each fixed r there is a C such that if \[ p=p(n) > Cn^{-\tfrac{2}{r+1}}\log^{\tfrac{2}{(r+1)(r-2)}}n, \] then $\Pr(t_r(G_{n,p})=b_r(G_{n,p}))\rightarrow 1$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.   This is best possible (apart from the value of $C$) and settles a question first considered by Babai, Simonovits and Spencer about 25 years ago.

TITLE: On Turán problems for Cartesian products of graphs
AUTHORS: Alexander Sidorenko
ABSTRACT: Let $A,B$ be disjoint sets of sizes $n$ and $m$. Let ${\mathcal Q}$ be a family of quadruples, having $2$ elements from $A$ and $2$ from $B$, such that any subset $S \subseteq A \cup B$ with $|S|=7$, $|S \cap A| \geq 2$ and $|S \cap B| \geq 2$ contains one of the quadruples. We prove that the smallest size of ${\mathcal Q}$ is $(1/16 + O(1/n) + O(1/m)) n^2 m^2$ as $n,m\to\infty$. We also solve asymptotically a more general two-partite Tur\'{a}n problem for quadruples.

TITLE: Some stability and exact results in generalized Turán problems
AUTHORS: Dániel Gerbner
ABSTRACT: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Stability refers to the usual phenomenon that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains almost $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$, than $G$ is in some sense similar to some extremal graph. We obtain new stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems and derive several new exact results.

Recently there has been interest in studying the case $\mathcal{F}=\{F,M_{s+1}\}$ for arbitrary $F$ and $H=K_r$. We extend these investigations to the case $H$ is arbitrary as well.

ABSTRACT: For graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $ex(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We consider this problem when both $H$ and $F$ have at most four vertices. We give sharp results in almost all cases, and connect the remaining cases to well-known unsolved problems. Our main new contribution is applying the progressive induction method of Simonovits for generalized Tur\'an problems.

TITLE: Daisies and Other Turan Problems

ABSTRACT: We make some conjectures about extremal densities of daisy-free families, where a `daisy' is a certain hypergraph. These questions turn out to be related to some Turan problems in the hypercube, but they are also natural in their own right.

ABSTRACT: Turan's theorem implies that every graph of order n with more edges than the r-partite Turan graph contains a complete graph of order r+1. We show that the same premise implies the existence of much larger graphs. We also prove corresponding stability theorems. These results complete work started by Erdos in 1963.

ABSTRACT: We prove that if the spectral radius of a graph G of order n is larger than the spectral radius of the r-partite Turan graph of the same order, then G contains various supergraphs of the complete graph of order r+1. In particular G contains a complete r-partite graph of size log n with one edge added to the first part. These results complete a project of Erdos from 1963. We also give corresponding stability results.

TITLE: Turán numbers of extensions

ABSTRACT: The extension of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is obtained from it by adding for every pair of vertices of $G$, which is not covered by an edge in $G$, an extra edge containing this pair and $r-2$ new vertices. Keevash and Sidorenko~ have previously determined Tur\'an densities of two families of hypergraph extensions. We determine the Tur\'an numbers for these families, using classical stability techniques and new tools introduced in our earlier paper.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Limited Feedback on Measurements: Sharing a Codebook or a Generative
  Model?
AUTHORS: Nurettin Turan, Benedikt Fesl, Michael Joham, Zhengxiang Ma, Anthony C. K. Soong, Baoling Sheen, Weimin Xiao, Wolfgang Utschick
ABSTRACT: Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based solutions are well-established for limited feedback schemes in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve higher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the propagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a versatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was recently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits low complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility concerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment knowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for online inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders using either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A major shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is only evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to fully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the question of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world measurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based solution. Our experiments reveal that the GMM-based feedback scheme tremendously improves the system performance measured in terms of sum-rate, allowing to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.

ABSTRACT: We present an interpretation of Deepcode, a learned feedback code that showcases higher-order error correction relative to an earlier interpretable model. By interpretation, we mean succinct analytical encoder and decoder expressions (albeit with learned parameters) in which the role of feedback in achieving error correction is easy to understand. By higher-order, we mean that longer sequences of large noise values are acted upon by the encoder (which has access to these through the feedback) and used in error correction at the decoder in a two-stage decoding process.

ABSTRACT: In this letter, we propose a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE)-based feedback scheme for robust precoder design in multi-user frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. We demonstrate how the VQ-VAE can be tailored to specific propagation environments, focusing on systems with low pilot overhead, which is crucial in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Extensive simulations with real-world measurement data show that our proposed feedback scheme outperforms state-of-the-art autoencoder (AE)-based compression schemes and conventional Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based schemes. These improvements enable the deployment of systems with fewer feedback bits or pilots.

ABSTRACT: This letter proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework for statistical precoder design that leverages model-based insights to compactly represent statistical knowledge, resulting in efficient, lightweight architectures. The framework also supports approximate statistical information in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems obtained through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based limited feedback scheme in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low pilot overhead. Simulations using a spatial channel model and measurement data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It outperforms baseline methods, including stochastic iterative algorithms and Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based approaches, particularly in low pilot overhead systems.

[PAPER 5]
TITLE: Enhancement of Throat Microphone Recordings Using Gaussian Mixture Model
  Probabilistic Estimator
AUTHORS: Mehmet Ali Tugtekin Turan
ABSTRACT: The throat microphone is a body-attached transducer that is worn against the neck. It captures the signals that are transmitted through the vocal folds, along with the buzz tone of the larynx. Due to its skin contact, it is more robust to the environmental noise compared to the acoustic microphone that picks up the vibrations through air pressure, and hence the all interventions. The throat speech is partly intelligible, but gives unnatural and croaky sound. This thesis tries to recover missing frequency bands of the throat speech and investigates envelope and excitation mapping problem with joint analysis of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings. A new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral envelope mapping scheme, which performs the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the acoustic-microphone spectral envelope, has been proposed. In the source-filter decomposition framework, we observed that the spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings is an important source of the degradation in the throat-microphone voice quality. Thus, we also model spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals as a spectral tilt vector, and propose a new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral tilt mapping scheme to enhance throat excitation signal. Experimental evaluations are performed to compare the proposed mapping scheme using both objective and subjective evaluations. Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) and the wide-band perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics. Subjective evaluations are performed with A/B pair comparison listening test. Both objective and subjective evaluations yield that the proposed phone-dependent mapping consistently improves performances over the state-of-the-art GMM estimators.

  (3,4)-problem
Abstract: In 1941, Turan conjectured that the edge density of any 3-graph without independent sets on 4 vertices (Turan (3,4)-graph) is >= 4/9(1-o(1)), and he gave the first example witnessing this bound. Brown (1983) and Kostochka (1982) found many other examples of this density. Fon-der-Flaass (1988) presented a general construction that converts an arbitrary $\vec C_4$-free orgraph $\Gamma$ into a Turan (3,4)-graph. He observed that all Turan-Brown-Kostochka examples result from his construction, and proved the bound >= 3/7(1-o(1)) on the edge density of any Turan (3,4)-graph obtainable in this way.   In this paper we establish the optimal bound 4/9(1-o(1)) on the edge density of any Turan (3,4)-graph resulting from the Fon-der-Flaass construction under any of the following assumptions on the undirected graph $G$ underlying the orgraph $\Gamma$:   1. $G$ is complete multipartite;   2. The edge density of $G$ is >= (2/3-epsilon) for some absolute constant epsilon>0.   We are also able to improve Fon-der-Flaass's bound to 7/16(1-o(1)) without any extra assumptions on $\Gamma$.

Abstract: Turan's theorem implies that every graph of order n with more edges than the r-partite Turan graph contains a complete graph of order r+1. We show that the same premise implies the existence of much larger graphs. We also prove corresponding stability theorems. These results complete work started by Erdos in 1963.

Abstract: The Turan number of a graph H, ex(n,H), is the maximum number of edges in a graph on n vertices which does not have H as a subgraph. We determine the Turan number and find the unique extremal graph for forests consisting of paths when n is sufficiently large. This generalizes a result of Bushaw and Kettle [ Combinatorics, Probability and Computing 20:837--853, 2011]. We also determine the Turan number and extremal graphs for forests consisting of stars of arbitrary order.

Abstract: We identify three 3-graphs on five vertices each missing in all known extremal configurations for Turan's (3,4)-problem and prove Turan's conjecture for 3-graphs that are additionally known not to contain any induced copies of these 3-graphs. Our argument is based on an (apparently) new technique of "indirect interpretation" that allows us to retrieve additional structure from hypothetical counterexamples to Turan's conjecture, but in rather loose and limited sense. We also include two miscellaneous calculations in flag algebras that prove similar results about some other additional forbidden subgraphs.

Abstract: We study the following question posed by Turan. Suppose K is a convex body in Euclidean space which is symmetric with respect to the origin. Of all positive definite functions supported in K, and with value 1 at the origin, which one has the largest integral? It is probably the case that the extremal function is the indicator of the half-body convolved with itself and properly scaled, but this has been proved only for a small class of domains so far. We add to this class of known "Turan domains" the class of all spectral convex domains. These are all convex domains which have an orthogonal basis of complex exponentials. As a corollary we obtain that all convex domains which tile space by translation are Turan domains. We also give a new proof that the Euclidean ball is a Turan domain.

Abstract: Let l>k>2. Let the k-graph H^k_l be obtained from the complete 2-graph K_l^2 by enlarging each edge with a new set of k-2 vertices. Mubayi ["A hypergraph extension of Turan's theorem", to appear in J. Combin. Th. (B)] computed asymptotically the Turan function ex(n,H_l^k). Here we determine the exact value of ex(n,H_l^k) for all sufficiently large n, settling a conjecture of Mubayi.

  hypercube Q_n
Abstract: The n-dimensional hypercube Q_n is a graph with vertex set {0,1}^n such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3) for all n >= 3.

Abstract: We show how Turan's inequality $P_n(x)^2-P_{n-1}(x)P_{n+1}(x)\geq 0$ for Legendre polynomials and related inequalities can be proven by means of a computer procedure. The use of this procedure simplifies the daily work with inequalities. For instance, we have found the stronger inequality $|x|P_n(x)^2-P_{n-1}(x)P_{n+1}(x)\geq 0$, $-1\leq x\leq 1$, effortlessly with the aid of our method.

Abstract: We prove that if the spectral radius of a graph G of order n is larger than the spectral radius of the r-partite Turan graph of the same order, then G contains various supergraphs of the complete graph of order r+1. In particular G contains a complete r-partite graph of size log n with one edge added to the first part. These results complete a project of Erdos from 1963. We also give corresponding stability results.

  in SRAMs
Abstract: Prior works propose SRAM-based TRNGs that extract entropy from SRAM arrays. SRAM arrays are widely used in a majority of specialized or general-purpose chips that perform the computation to store data inside the chip. Thus, SRAM-based TRNGs present a low-cost alternative to dedicated hardware TRNGs. However, existing SRAM-based TRNGs suffer from 1) low TRNG throughput, 2) high energy consumption, 3) high TRNG latency, and 4) the inability to generate true random numbers continuously, which limits the application space of SRAM-based TRNGs. Our goal in this paper is to design an SRAM-based TRNG that overcomes these four key limitations and thus, extends the application space of SRAM-based TRNGs. To this end, we propose TuRaN, a new high-throughput, energy-efficient, and low-latency SRAM-based TRNG that can sustain continuous operation. TuRaN leverages the key observation that accessing SRAM cells results in random access failures when the supply voltage is reduced below the manufacturer-recommended supply voltage. TuRaN generates random numbers at high throughput by repeatedly accessing SRAM cells with reduced supply voltage and post-processing the resulting random faults using the SHA-256 hash function. To demonstrate the feasibility of TuRaN, we conduct SPICE simulations on different process nodes and analyze the potential of access failure for use as an entropy source. We verify and support our simulation results by conducting real-world experiments on two commercial off-the-shelf FPGA boards. We evaluate the quality of the random numbers generated by TuRaN using the widely-adopted NIST standard randomness tests and observe that TuRaN passes all tests. TuRaN generates true random numbers with (i) an average (maximum) throughput of 1.6Gbps (1.812Gbps), (ii) 0.11nJ/bit energy consumption, and (iii) 278.46us latency.

Abstract: Given a graph H, the planar Turan number of H, denoted by ex_P(n, H), is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex H-free planar graph. Ghosh, Gyori, Paulos and Xiao initiated the topic of the planar Turan number for double stars. A (k,l)-star, denoted by S_{k,l}, is the graph obtained from an edge uv, and joining end vertices with k and l vertices, respectively. However, the exact value of ex_P(n, S_{3,5}) remains unknown. Building upon this research, we further investigate the problem. A k-l edge refers to an edge whose endpoints have degrees k and l, respectively. In this paper, we establish an upper bound for the planar Turan number of a graph G that does not contain the double star S_{3,5} or any 6-6 edges, which is 23n/8 - 3 for all n >= 2.

Abstract: Turan's method, as expressed in his books, is a careful study of trigonometric polynomials from different points of view. The present article starts from a problem asked by Turan: how to construct a sequence of real numbers x(j) (j= 1,2,...n) such that the almost periodic polynomial whose frequencies are the x(j) and the coefficients are 1 are small (say, their absolute values are less than n d, d< given) for all integral values of the variable m between 1 and M= M(n,d) ? The best known answer is a random choice of the x(j) modulo 1. Using the random choice as Turan (and before him Erd\"os and Renyi), we improve the estimate of M (n, d) and we discuss an explicit construction derived from another chapter of Turan's book. The main part of the paper deals with the corresponding problem when R / Z is replaced by Z / NZ, N prime, and m takes all integral values modulo 1 except 0. Then it has an interpretation in signal theory, when a signal is representad by a function on the cyclic goup G = Z / NZ and the frequencies by the dual cyclic group G^ : knowing that the signal is carried by T points, to evaluate the probability that a random choice of a set W of frequencies allows to recover the signal x from the restriction of its Fourier tranform to W by the process of minimal extrapolation in the Wiener algebra of G^(process of Cand\`es, Romberg and Tao). Some random choices were considered in the original article of CRT and the corresponding probabilities were estimated in two preceding papers of mine. Here we have another random choice, associated with occupancy problems.

The dependence of the differential branching ratio on the photon energy and the branching ratio on the two Higgs doublet model parameters, m_{H^\pm} and \tan \beta, are studied. It is shown that there is an enhancement in the predictions of the two Higgs doublet model compared to the Standard model case. We also observe that contributions of neutral Higgs bosons to the decay are sizable when \tan\beta is large.

We show that this extremum problem for rational $h=p/q$ is equivalent two finite-dimensional linear programming problems. Here there are exact results for rational $h=2/q$, $h=p/(2p+1)$, $h=3/q$, and asymptotic equalities.

  estimate in Wigner's law
Abstract: We prove the Erdos-Turan equidistribution inequality, using a construction due to Chebyshev, Markov, and Stieltjes. The method is applicable in a more general setting. As an example, we state another inequality that can be proved using this method. The inequality can be used to get an error estimate in Wigner's law which is sharp near the edge.

  junction
Abstract: We calculate the contribution to the spin transfer torque from sequential tunneling through impurities in a magnetic tunnel junction. For a junction with weakly polarized ferromagnetic contacts, the torque is found to be in the plane spanned by the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic contacts and proportional to $\sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic moments. If the polarization is larger, the torque acquires a significant out-of-plane component and a different dependence on $\theta$.

Abstract: Several supersymmetric models with extended gauge structures, motivated by either grand unification or by neutrino mass generation, predict light doubly-charged Higgsinos. In this work we study the signals of doubly-charged Higgsinos at the Tevatron in both pair-- and single--production modes, and show that it is possible, especially from the events containing same-sign same-flavor isolated leptons, to disentangle the effects of doubly-charged Higgsinos in the Tevatron data.

Abstract: In this paper, we define and compare four new measures of graph irregularity. We use these measures to prove upper bounds for the chromatic number and the Colin de Verdiere parameter. We also strengthen the concise Turan theorem for irregular graphs and investigate to what extent Turan's theorem can be similarly strengthened for generalized r-partite graphs. We conclude by relating these new measures to the Randic index and using the measures to devise new normalised indices of network heterogeneity.

  ferroelectricity in EuTiO3 from first principles
Abstract: We elucidate the microscopic mechanism that causes a suppression of ferroelectricity and an enhancement of octahedral rotations in EuTiO3 from first principles. We find that the hybridization of the rare-earth Eu 4f states with the B-site Ti cation drives the system away from ferroelectricity. We also show that the magnetic order dependence of this hybridization is the dominant source of spin-phonon coupling in this material. Our results underline the importance of rare-earth f electrons on the lattice dynamics and stability of these transition metal oxides.

Abstract: We determine the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with the property that none of its $r$-cliques intersects a fixed set $M\subset V(G)$. For $(r-1)|M|\ge n$, the $(r-1)$-partite Turan graph turns out to be the unique extremal graph. For $(r-1)|M|<n$, there is a whole family of extremal graphs, which we describe explicitly. In addition we provide corresponding stability results.

Abstract: Discovery of new transition metal compounds with large spin orbit coupling (SOC) coexisting with strong electron-electron correlation among the $d$ electrons is essential for understanding the physics that emerges from the interplay of these two effects. In this study, we predict a novel class of $J_{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators in a family of fluoride compounds that are previously synthesized, but not characterized extensively. First principles calculations in the level of all electron Density Functional Theory + Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT) indicate that these compounds have large Mott gaps and some of them exhibit unprecedented proximity to the ideal, $SU(2)$ symmetric $J_{eff}=1/2$ limit.

Abstract: First principles methods can provide insight into materials that is otherwise impossible to acquire. Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been the first principles method of choice for numerous applications, but it falls short of predicting the properties of correlated materials. First principles Density Functional Theory + Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT) is a powerful tool that can address these shortcomings of DFT when applied to correlated metals. In this brief review, which is aimed at non-experts, we review the basics and some applications of DFT+DMFT.

We also find the associate space and dual of this space, and we prove that the grand Wiener amalgam space is not reflexive.

Abstract: In $ \left[14\right]$, a new family called grand amalgam space $W( L^{p),\theta},L^{q),\theta })$ of amalgam spaces was defined and investigated properties of these spaces.

In Section 2, we introduce another equivalent but discrete definition of grand amalgam space and study properties of these spaces. In Section 3, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions on a locally compact Abelian group $G$ for the grand amalgam spaces $W(L^{p,)\theta},L^ {q,\theta})$ to be an algebra under convolution.

The interaction of Alfie is designed in a way in which the user can offer an alternative answer when the user disagrees with the given answer so that Alfie can learn from its interactions. Alfie's answers are based on a sentence embedding model that uses state-of-the-art language models, e.g. Universal Sentence Encoder and BERT. Alfie is implemented on a Furhat Robot, which provides a customizable user interface to design a social robot.

  Ferroelectrics
Abstract: Integration of ferroelectric materials into novel technological applications requires low coercive field materials, and consequently, design strategies to reduce the ferroelectric switching barriers. In this first principles study, we show that biaxial strain, which has a strong effect on the ferroelectric ground states, can also be used to tune the switching barrier of hybrid improper ferroelectric Ruddlesden-Popper oxides. We identify the region of the strain -- tolerance factor phase diagram where this intrinsic barrier is suppressed, and show that it can be explained in relation to strain induced phase transitions to nonpolar phases.

Abstract: Doping ferroelectrics with carriers is often detrimental to polarization. This makes the design and discovery of metals that undergo a ferroelectric-like transition challenging. In this letter, we show from first principles that the oxygen octahedral rotations in perovskites are often enhanced by electron doping, and this can be used as a means to strengthen the structural polarization in certain hybrid-improper ferroelectrics -- compounds in which the polarization is not stabilized by the long range Coulomb interactions but is instead induced by a trilinear coupling to octahedral rotations. We use this design strategy to predict a cation ordered Ruddlesden-Popper compound that can be driven into a metallic ferroelectric-like phase via electrolyte gating.

  series
Abstract: Neural differential equations have recently emerged as a flexible data-driven/hybrid approach to model time-series data. This work experimentally demonstrates that if the data contains oscillations, then standard fitting of a neural differential equation may result in a flattened out trajectory that fails to describe the data. We then introduce the multiple shooting method and present successful demonstrations of this method for the fitting of a neural differential equation to two datasets (synthetic and experimental) that the standard approach fails to fit. Constraints introduced by multiple shooting can be satisfied using a penalty or augmented Lagrangian method.

Abstract: The planar Turan number $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ is the largest number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph with no $\ell$-cycle. For $\ell\in \{3,4,5,6\}$, upper bounds on $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ are known that hold with equality infinitely often. Ghosh, Gy\"{o}ri, Martin, Paulo, and Xiao [arxiv:2004.14094] conjectured an upper bound on $\textrm{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}(C_{\ell},n)$ for every $\ell\ge 7$ and $n$ sufficiently large. We disprove this conjecture for every $\ell\ge 11$. We also propose two revised versions of the conjecture.

  problems
Abstract: We study extensions of Tur\'an Theorem in edge-weighted settings. A particular case of interest is when constraints on the weight of an edge come from the order of the largest clique containing it. These problems are motivated by Ramsey-Tur\'an type problems. Some of our proofs are based on the method of graph Lagrangians, while the other proofs use flag algebras. Using these results, we prove several new upper bounds on the Ramsey-Tur\'an density of cliques. Other applications of our results are in a recent paper of Balogh, Chen, McCourt and Murley.

Abstract: The limit $q$-Durrmeyer operator, $D_{\infty,q},$ was introduced and its approximation properties were investigated by V. Gupta in 2008 during a study of $q$-analogues for the Bernstein-Durrmeyer operator. In the present work, this operator is investigated from a different perspective. More precisely, the growth estimates are derived for the entire functions comprising the range of $D_{\infty,q}$. The interrelation between the analytic properties of a function $f$ and the rate of growth for $D_{\infty,q}f$ are established, and the sharpness of the obtained results are demonstrated.

Abstract: In this work, we utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to capture the underlying probability density function (PDF) of the channel trajectories of moving mobile terminals (MTs) within the coverage area of a base station (BS) in an offline phase. We propose to leverage the same GMM for channel prediction in the online phase. Our proposed approach does not require signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-specific training and allows for parallelization. Numerical simulations for both synthetic and measured channel data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GMM-based channel predictor compared to state-ofthe-art channel prediction methods.

  Systems
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE)-based feedback scheme for robust precoder design in multi-user frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. We demonstrate how the VQ-VAE can be tailored to specific propagation environments, focusing on systems with low pilot overhead, which is crucial in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Extensive simulations with real-world measurement data show that our proposed feedback scheme outperforms state-of-the-art autoencoder (AE)-based compression schemes and conventional Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based schemes. These improvements enable the deployment of systems with fewer feedback bits or pilots.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new proof of a density version of Tur\'an's theorem. We also rephrase both the theorem and the proof using entropy. With the entropic formulation, we show that some naturally defined entropic quantity is closely connected to other common quantities such as Lagrangian and spectral radius. In addition, we also determine the Tur\'an density for a new family of hypergraphs, which we call tents. Our result can be seen as a new generalization of Mubayi's result on the extended cliques.

  conjecture
Abstract: Let A be a set of nonnegative integers. For every nonnegative integer n and positive integer h, let r_{A}(n,h) denote the number of representations of n in the form n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_h, where a_1, a_2,..., a_h are elements of A and a_1 \leq a_2 \leq ... \leq a_h. The infinite set A is called a basis of order h if r_{A}(n,h) \geq 1 for every nonnegative integer n. Erdos and Turan conjectured that limsup_{n\to\infty} r_A(n,2) = \infty for every basis A of order 2. This paper introduces a new class of additive bases and a general additive problem, a special case of which is the Erdos-Turan conjecture. Konig's lemma on the existence of infinite paths in certain graphs is used to prove that this general problem is equivalent to a related problem about finite sets of nonnegative integers.

Abstract: Much of extremal graph theory has concentrated either on finding very small subgraphs of a large graph (Turan-type results) or on finding spanning subgraphs (Dirac-type results). In this paper we are interested in finding intermediate-sized subgraphs. We investigate minimum degree conditions under which a graph G contains squared paths and squared cycles of arbitrary specified lengths. We determine precise thresholds, assuming that the order of G is large. This extends results of Fan and Kierstead [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 63 (1995), 55--64] and of Komlos, Sarkozy, and Szemeredi [Random Structures Algorithms 9 (1996), 193--211] concerning the containment of a spanning squared path and a spanning squared cycle, respectively. Our results show that such minimum degree conditions constitute not merely an interpolation between the corresponding Turan-type and Dirac-type results, but exhibit other interesting phenomena.

  evaluation
Abstract: The Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) lower bound on the maximum cardinality of a q-ary code of length n with minimum Hamming distance at least d can be obtained by application of Turan's theorem to the graph with vertex set {0,1,..,q-1}^n in which two vertices are joined if and only if their Hamming distance is at least d. We generalize the GV bound by applying Turan's theorem to the graph with vertex set C^n, where C is a q-ary code of length m and two vertices are joined if and only if their Hamming distance at least d. We asymptotically evaluate the resulting bound for n-> \infty and d \delta mn for fixed \delta > 0, and derive conditions on the distance distribution of C that are necessary and sufficient for the asymptotic generalized bound to beat the asymptotic GV bound. By invoking the Delsarte inequalities, we conclude that no improvement on the asymptotic GV bound is obtained. By using a sharpening of Turan's theorem due to Caro and Wei, we improve on our bound. It is undecided if there exists a code C for which the improved bound can beat the asymptotic GV bound.

Abstract: A Kneser representation KG(H) for a graph G is a bijective assignment of hyperedges of a hypergraph H to the vertices of G such that two vertices of G are adjacent if and only if the corresponding hyperedges are disjoint. In this paper, we introduce a colored version of the Turan number and use that to determine the chromatic number of some families of graphs in terms of the generalized Turan number of graphs. In particular, we determine the chromatic number of every Kneser multigraph KG(H), where the vertex set of H is the edge set of a multigraph G such that the multiplicity of each edge is greater than 1 and a hyperedge in H corresponds to a subgraph of G isomorphic to some graph in a fixed prescribed family of simple graphs.

Abstract: In this paper we define a class of combinatorial structures the instances of which can each be thought of as a model of directed hypergraphs in some way. Each of these models is uniform in that all edges have the same internal structure, and each is simple in that no loops or multiedges are allowed. We generalize the concepts of Turan density, blowup density, and jumps to this class and show that many basic extremal results extend naturally in this new setting. In particular, we show that supersaturation holds, the blowup of a generalized directed hypergraph (GDH) has the same Turan density as the GDH itself, and degenerate GDHs (those with Turan density zero) can be characterized as being contained in a blowup of a single edge. Additionally, we show how the set of jumps from one kind of GDH relates to the set of jumps of another. Since r-uniform hypergraphs are an instance of the defined class, then we are able to derive many particular instances of jumps and nonjumps for GDHs in general based on known results.

Abstract: Given a positive integer $n$ and an $r$-uniform hypergraph (or $r$-graph for short) $F$, the Turan number $ex(n,F)$ of $F$ is the maximum number of edges in an $r$-graph on $n$ vertices that does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. The extension $H^F $ of $F$ is obtained as follows: For each pair of vertices $v_i,v_j$ in $F$ not contained in an edge of $F$, we add a set $B_{ij}$ of $r-2$ new vertices and the edge $\{v_i,v_j\} \cup B_{ij}$, where the $B_{ij}$ 's are pairwise disjoint over all such pairs $\{i,j\}$. Let $K^r_p$ denote the complete $r$-graph on $p$ vertices. For all sufficiently large $n$, we determine the Turan numbers of the extensions of a $3$-uniform $t$-matching, a $3$-uniform linear star of size $t$, and a $4$-uniform linear star of size $t$, respectively. We also show that the unique extremal hypergraphs are balanced blowups of $K^3_{3t-1}, K^3_{2t}$, and $K^4_{3t}$, respectively. Our results generalize the recent result of Hefetz and Keevash [7].

Abstract: Let G be a locally compact abelian group (LCA group) and U be an open, 0-symmetric set. Let F:=F(U) be the set of all real valued continuous functions from G to R which are supported in U and are positive definite. The Turan constant T(U) of U is then defined as the supremum of the integral of any f on U, which belongs to F and is normalised to have f(0)=1.   Mihalis Kolountzakis and the author has shown that structural properties - like spectrality, tiling or packing with a certain set L - of subsets U in finite or compact groups and on R^d and in Z^d, yield estimates of T(U). However, in these estimates some notion of the size, i.e. density of L, played a natural role, and thus in groups where we had no grasp of the notion, we could not accomplish such estimates.   In the present work recent new notions of uniform asymptotic upper density are invoked, allowing a more general investigation of the Turan constant in relation to the above structural properties. Our main result extends a result of Arestov and Berdysheva, (also obtained independently and along different lines by Kolountzakis and the author), stating that convex tiles of a Euclidean space necessarily have T(U) =|U|/2^{d}. In our extension R^d could be replaced by any LCA group, convexity is dropped, and the condition of tiling is also relaxed to a certain packing type condition and positive uniform asymptotic upper density of the set L.

Abstract: This paper is motivated by the question of how global and dense restriction sets in results from extremal combinatorics can be replaced by less global and sparser ones. The result we consider here as an example is Turan's theorem, which deals with graphs G=([n],E) such that no member of the restriction set consisting of all r-tuples on [n] induces a copy of K_r.   Firstly, we examine what happens when this restriction set is replaced just by all r-tuples touching a given m-element set. That is, we determine the maximal number of edges in an n-vertex such that no K_r hits a given vertex set.   Secondly, we consider sparse random restriction sets. An r-uniform hypergraph R on vertex set [n] is called Turannical (respectively epsilon-Turannical), if for any graph G on [n] with more edges than the Turan number ex(n,K_r) (respectively (1+\eps)ex(n,K_r), no hyperedge of R induces a copy of K_r in G. We determine the thresholds for random r-uniform hypergraphs to be Turannical and to epsilon-Turannical.   Thirdly, we transfer this result to sparse random graphs, using techniques recently developed by Schacht [Extremal results for random discrete structures] to prove the Kohayakawa-Luczak-Rodl Conjecture on Turan's theorem in random graphs.

Abstract: In 2002, Nikiforov proved that for an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with clique number $\omega$ and edge number $m$, the spectral radius $\lambda(G)$ satisfies $\lambda (G) \leq \sqrt{2(1 - 1/\omega) m}$, which confirmed a conjecture implicitly suggested by Edwards and Elphick. In this paper, we prove a local version of spectral Tur\'an inequality, which states that $\lambda^2(G)\leq 2\sum_{e\in E(G)}\frac{c(e)-1}{c(e)}$, where $c(e)$ is the order of the largest clique containing the edge $e$ in $G$. We also characterize the extremal graphs. We prove that our theorem implies Nikiforov's theorem and give an example to show that the difference of Nikiforov's bound and ours is $\Omega (\sqrt{m})$ for some cases. Additionally, we establish a spectral counterpart to Ore's problem (1962) which asks for the maximum size of an $n$-vertex graph such that its complement is connected and does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Our result leads to a new spectral Tur\'an inequality applicable to graphs with connected complements. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Gregory, asserting that for a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with chromatic number $k\geq 2$ and an independent set $S$, we have \[ \sum_{v\in S} x_v^2 \leq \frac{1}{2} - \frac{k-2}{2\sqrt{(k-2)^2 + 4(k-1)(n-k+1)}}, \] where $x_v$ is the component of the Perron vector of $G$ with respect to the vertex $v$. A modified version of Gregory's conjecture is proposed.

Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Stability refers to the usual phenomenon that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains almost $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$, than $G$ is in some sense similar to some extremal graph. We obtain new stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems and derive several new exact results.

  $K3$ surfaces
Abstract: We consider three different families of Vafa-Witten invariants of $K3$ surfaces. In each case, the partition function that encodes the Vafa-Witten invariants is given by combinations of twisted Dedekind $\eta$-functions. By utilising known properties of these $\eta$-functions, we obtain exact formulae for each of the invariants and prove that they asymptotically satisfy all higher-order Tur\'{a}n inequalities.

Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We consider the case where $\chi(H)<\chi(F)$. There are several exact results on $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ when the extremal graph is a complete $(\chi(F)-1)$-partite graph. We obtain multiple exact results with other kinds of extremal graphs.

Abstract: Given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. For every $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, we present an extremal graph for a generalized Tur\'an problem, i.e., an $F$-free $n$ vertex graph $G$ that for some $H$ contains exactly $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ copies of $H$.

Abstract: Given a circuit $C : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ from a circuit class $F$, with $m > n$, finding a $y \in \{0,1\}^m$ such that $\forall x \in \{0,1\}^n$, $C(x) \ne y$, is the range avoidance problem (denoted by $F$-$avoid$). Deterministic polynomial time algorithms (even with access to $NP$ oracles) solving this problem is known to imply explicit constructions of various pseudorandom objects like hard Boolean functions, linear codes, PRGs etc. Deterministic polynomial time algorithms are known for $NC^0_2$-$avoid$ when $m > n$, and for $NC^0_3$-$avoid$ when $m \ge \frac{n^2}{\log n}$, where $NC^0_k$ is the class of circuits with bounded fan-in which have constant depth and the output depends on at most $k$ of the input bits. On the other hand, it is also known that $NC^0_3$-$avoid$ when $m = n+O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ is at least as hard as explicit construction of rigid matrices.   In this paper, we propose a new approach to solving range avoidance problem via hypergraphs. We formulate the problem in terms of Turan-type problems in hypergraphs of the following kind - for a fixed $k$-uniform hypergraph $H'$, what is the maximum number of edges that can exist in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ which does not have a sub-hypergraph isomorphic to $H'$? We use our approach to show (using known Turan-type bounds) that there is a constant $c$ such that $mon$-$NC^0_3$-$avoid$ can be solved in deterministic polynomial time when $m > cn^2$. To improve the stretch constraint to linear, we show a new Turan-type theorem for a hypergraph structure (which we call the the loose $chi$-cycles) and use it to show that $mon$-$NC^0_3$-$avoid$ can be solved in deterministic polynomial time when $m > n$, thus improving the known bounds of $NC^0_3$-avoid for the case of monotone circuits.

Abstract: Using the most general model independent form of the effective Hamiltonian, the rare B_s --> \gamma \ell^+ \ell^- decays are studied by taking into account the polarization of the photon. The total and the differential branching ratios for these decays, when photon is in the positive and negative helicity states, are presented. Dependence of these observables on the new Wilson coefficients are studied. It is also investigated the sensitivity of "photon polarization asymmetry" in B_s --> \gamma \ell^+ \ell^- decays to the new Wilson coefficients. It has been shown that all these physical observables are very sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond SM and their experimental measurements can give valuable information about it.

Abstract: Colladay and Kostelecky have proposed a framework for studying Lorentz and CPT violation in a natural extension of the Standard Model. Although numerous bounds exist on the Lorentz and CPT violating parameters in the gauge boson and fermion sectors, there are no published bounds on the parameters in the Higgs sector. We determine these bounds. The bounds on the CPT-even asymmetric coefficients arise from the one-loop contributions to the photon propagator, those from the CPT-even symmetric coefficients arise from the equivalent c_{\mu\nu} coefficients in the fermion sector, and those from the CPT-odd coefficient arise from bounds on the vacuum expectation value of the Z-boson.

Abstract: In this talk, I discuss possible bounds on the Lorentz and CPT violating parameters in the Higgs sector of the so called minimal standard model extension. The main motivation to this study is coming from the fact that unlike the parameters in the fermion and gauge sector, there are no published bounds on the parameters in the Higgs sector. From the one-loop contributions to the photon propagator the bounds on the CPT-even asymmetric coefficients are obtained and the c_\mu\nu coefficients in the fermion sector determine the bound on the CPT-even symmetric coefficients. The CPT-odd coefficient is bounded from the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the Z-boson.

Abstract: We study the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, CP-violating asymmetry, CP-violating asymmetry in the forward-backward asymmetry and polarization asymmetries of the final lepton in the B-> X_d \ell^+\ell^- decays in the context of a CP softly broken two Higgs doublet model. We analyze the dependencies of these observables on the model parameters by paying a special attention to the effects of neutral Higgs boson (NHB) exchanges and possible CP violating effects. We find that NHB effects are quite significant for the \tau mode. The above-mentioned observables seems to be promising as a testing ground for new physics beyond the SM, especially for the existence of the CP-violating phase in the theory.

Abstract: We present a complete analysis of the neutral fermion sector of supersymmetric E_6-inspired low energy models containing an extra SU(2), concentrating on the Alternate Left-Right and Inert models. We show that the R-parity conserving scenario always exhibits a large Dirac mass for \nu_L with maximal mixing with an isosinglet neutrino, and that R-parity violating scenarios do not change the picture other than allowing further mixing with another isosinglet. In order to recover Standard Model phenomenology, additional assumptions in the form of discrete symmetries and/or new interactions are needed. We introduce and investigate Discrete Symmetry method and Higher Dimensional Operators as mechanisms for solving the neutrino mass and mixing problems in these models.

Abstract: The nonzero widths of heavy particles become significant when they appear in the final state of any decay occurring just around its kinematical threshold. To take into account such effects, a procedure, called the convolution method, was proposed by Altarelli, Conti and Lubicz. We expand their study which included only threshold effects for t-> bWZ in the standard model. We discuss finite width effects in the three body decays t-> cWW,cZZ and A^0(h^0)->tbW in the type III version of a two Higgs doublet model. In particular, we find a substantial enhancement in the decay t->cZZ, which brings its branching ratio to BR(t->cZZ)~10^-3, and in the decay A^0->tbW, which, unlike the h^0 case, becomes competitive with the A^0 two-body decay modes.

Abstract: We analyse top quark flavor violating decays into a charm quark and a gluon, photon or Z boson in a supersymmetric model incorporating left-right symmetry. We include loop calculations involving contributions from scalar quarks, gluinos, charginos and neutralinos. We perform the calculations first assuming the minimal (flavor diagonal) scalar quark scenario, and then allowing for arbitrary mixing between the second and third generation of scalar quarks, in both the up and down sectors. In each case we present separately the contributions from gluino, chargino and neutralino loops and compare their respective strengths. In the flavor-diagonal case, the branching ratio cannot exceed 10^-5 (10^-6) for the gluon (photon/Z boson); while for the unconstrained (flavor non-diagonal) case the same branching ratios can reach almost 10^-4 for the gluon, 10^-6 for the photon and 10^-5 for the Z boson, all of which are slightly below the expected reach of LHC.

Abstract: The left-right supersymmetric model contains a right-handed gaugino, as well as several higgsinos, in addition to the minimal supersymmetric model. Thus several CP-noninvariant phases appear in this sector. We analyze their impact on chargino masses and find that only two combinations are physically relevant. We then study the production of charginos in e+e- annihilation and chargino decays into a sneutrino and a lepton, and investigate the effects of CP-phases. We also study the CP-odd asymmetry in the production and subsequent decay at the linear collider with longitudinally polarized beams and find a large enhancement when the decay channel to the right sneutrino is available. The effects of the phases in the left-right supersymmetric chargino sector are different from the minimal supersymmetric standard model, and signals from this sector would be able to distinguish between different gauge symmetries.

We provide explicit solutions for the electromagnetic field using scalar field analogy, for both the cases in which the Lorentz violating terms come from the CPT-even or CPT-odd terms. We also calculate the effects of the Lorentz violating terms for a fermion field between two parallel conducting plates and analyze the modifications of the Casimir force due to the modifications of the Dirac equation. In all cases under consideration, the standard formulas for the Casimir force are modified by either multiplicative or additive correction factors, the latter case exhibiting different dependence on the distance between the plates.

The branching ratios are very small in all models, O(10^-14), except for the case of the unconstrained MSSM, where they can reach O(10^-6) for e+e- and nu_i bar nu_i, and O(10^-5) for tau+ tau-. This branching ratio is comparable to the ones for t-> c V, cH. We also study the production rates of single top and the forward-backward asymmetry in e+e- -> t cbar and comment on the observability of such a signal at the International Linear Collider.

Abstract: We discuss and compare the charge-parity (CP) asymmetry in the charged Higgs boson decays H -> \bar{u}_i d_j for the second and third generation quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. As part of the analysis, we derive some general analytical formulas for the imaginary parts of two-point and three-point scalar one-loop integrals and use them for calculating vectorial and tensorial type integrals needed for the problem under consideration. We find that, even though each decay mode has a potential to yield a CP asymmetry larger than 10%, further analysis based on the number of required charged Higgs events at colliders favors the \bar{t}b, \bar{c}b, and \bar{c}s channels, whose asymmetry could reach 10-15% in certain parts of the parameter space.

Abstract: Let s_v denote the pure power sum \sum_{k=1}^n z_k^v. In a previous paper we proved that \sqrt n <= \inf_{|z_k| => 1} \max_{v=1,...,n^2} |s_v| <= \sqrt{n+1} when n+1 is prime. In this paper we prove that \inf_{|z_k| = 1} \max_{v=1,...,n^2-n} |s_v| = \sqrt{n-1} when n-1 is a prime power, and if 2 <= i <= n-1 and n => 3 is a prime power then \inf_{|z_k| => 1} \max_{v=1,...,n^2-i} |s_v| =\sqrt n. We give explicit constructions of n-tuples (z_1,...,z_n) which we prove are global minima for these problems. These are two of the few times in Turan power sum theory where solutions in the inf max problem can be explicitly calculated.

Abstract: We discuss and compare the effects of one extra dimension in the Randall Sundrum models on the evaluation of the Casimir force between two parallel plates. We impose the condition that the result reproduce the experimental measurements within the known uncertainties in the force and the plate separation, and get an upper bound kR < 20 if the curvature parameter k of AdS_5 is equal to the Planck scale. Although the upper bound decreases as k decreases, kR ~ 12, which is the required value for solving the hierarchy problem, is consistent with the Casimir force measurements. For the case where the 5th dimension is infinite, the correction to the Casimir force is very small and negligible.

Abstract: We analyze the charge-parity (CP) asymmetry in the charged Higgs boson decays to chargino-neutralino pairs, H^- -> chargino_i + neutralino_j. We show first that these modes have a large branching ratio for m_H^- > 600 GeV. We use Cutkosky rules to obtain the analytical formulas needed for the evaluation of the asymmetry under consideration. We then calculate the CP asymmetry in chargino-neutralino decays by including supersymmetric mass bounds, as well as constraints from b -> s gamma, (g-2)_mu, Delta\rho and electric dipole moments. Finally, we discuss observability of the asymmetry at the LHC by calculating the number of required charged Higgs events to observe the asymmetry for each decay channel. We show that the inclusion of constraints considerably reduces the projected CP asymmetry, and that the optimal channel for observing the asymmetry is H^- -> chargino_1 + neutralino_2.

Abstract: We systematically analyze the integrability of a Pauli system in Lorentz violating background at the non-relativistic level both in two- and three-dimensions. We consider the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation from the QED sector of the so-called Standard Model Extension by keeping only two types of background couplings, the vector a_mu and the axial vector b_mu. We show that the spin-orbit interaction comes as a higher order correction in the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation. Such an interaction allows the inclusion of spin degree non-trivially, and if Lorentz violating terms are allowed, they might be comparable under special circumstances. By including all possible first-order derivative terms and considering the cases a\ne 0, b\ne 0, and b_0\ne 0 one at a time, we determine the possible forms of constants of motion operator, and discuss the existence or continuity of integrability due to Lorentz violating background.

Abstract: A sequential fourth generation of quarks and leptons is allowed by precision electroweak constraints if the mass splitting between the heavy quarks is between 50 and 80 GeV. Although heavy quarks can be easily detected at the LHC, it is very difficult to detect a sequential heavy charged lepton, L, due to large backgrounds. Should the L mass be above 250 GeV, it can not be pair-produced at a 500 GeV ILC. We calculate the cross section for the one-loop process e+e- -> L tau. Although the cross section is small, it may be detectable. We also consider contributions from the two Higgs doublet model and the Randall-Sundrum model, in which case the cross section can be substantially higher.

  Einstein Condensates
Abstract: Reviewing the ideas developed in, the ground state life time of a finite size atomic Bose Einstein condensate is studied for coherent, squeezed coherent and thermal coherent ground states. Ground state evolution of coherent and squeezed coherent states in a double well potential is studied. Effects of thin spectrum on Bose-Einstein condensates is discussed and quasiparticle excitation lifetimes are calculated. It is shown that the effect of the states we use on the free energy vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Possible extension to a double well potential and effect of a second broken symmetry is also discussed.

Abstract: Several supersymmetric models with extended gauge structures, motivated by either grand unification or by neutrino mass generation, predict light doubly-charged Higgsinos. In this work we study productions and decays of doubly-charged Higgsinos present in left-right supersymmetric models, and show that they invariably lead to novel collider signals not found in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) or in any of its extensions motivated by the \mu problem or even in extra dimensional theories. We investigate their distinctive signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in both pair-- and single--production modes, and show that they are powerful tools in determining the underlying model via the measurements at the LHC experiments.

Abstract: We evaluate the Casimir force between two parallel plates in Randall Sundrum (RS) scenarios extended by q compact dimensions. After giving exact expressions for one extra compact dimension (RS 6D model), we generalize to an arbitrary number of compact dimensions. We present the complete calculation for both two brane scenario (RSI model) and one brane scenario (RSII models) using the method of summing over the modes. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions on the magnitude and sign of the force, and comment on limits for the size and number of the extra dimensions.

Abstract: We describe a method that we believe may be foundational for a comprehensive theory of generalised Turan problems. The cornerstone of our approach is a quasirandom counting lemma for quasirandom hypergraphs, which extends the standard counting lemma by not only counting copies of a particular configuration but also showing that these copies are evenly distributed. We demonstrate the power of the method by proving a conjecture of Mubayi on the codegree threshold of the Fano plane, that any 3-graph on n vertices for which every pair of vertices is contained in more than n/2 edges must contain a Fano plane, for n sufficiently large. For projective planes over fields of odd size q we show that the codegree threshold is between n/2-q+1 and n/2, but for PG_2(4) we find the somewhat surprising phenomenon that the threshold is less than (1/2-c)n for some small c>0. We conclude by setting out a program for future developments of this method to tackle other problems.

Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite abelian group with $|2G|=|G|$. We show that if $G$ is not the direct sum of a group of exponent 3 and the group of order 2, then $G$ possesses a perfect additive basis; that is, there is a subset $S\subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ is uniquely representable as a sum of two elements of $S$. Moreover, if $G$ \emph{is} the direct sum of a group of exponent 3 and the group of order 2, then it does not have a perfect additive basis; however, in this case there is a subset $S\subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ has at most two representations (distinct under permuting the summands) as a sum of two elements of $S$. This solves completely the Erdos-Turan problem for infinite groups.   It is also shown that if $G$ is an abelian group of exponent 2, then there is a subset $S\subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ has a representation as a sum of two elements of $S$, and the number of representations of non-zero elements is bounded by an absolute constant.

Abstract: The well known Erdos-Turan law states that the logarithm of an order of a random permutation is asymptotically normally distributed. The aim of this work is to estimate convergence rate in this theorem and also to prove analogous result for distribution of the logarithm of an order of a random permutation on a certain class of subsets of the symmetric group. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the mean values of multiplicative functions on the symmetric group and the results we obtain are of independent interest besides their application to the investigation of the remainder term in the Erdos-Turan law.   We also study a related problem of distribution of the degree of a splitting field of a random polynomial and obtain sharp estimates for its convergence rate to normal law.   In research we apply both probabilistic and analytic methods. Some analytic methods used here have their origins in the probabilistic number theory, and some have their roots in the theory of summation of divergent series. One of the approaches we use is to apply Tauberian type estimates for Voronoi summability of divergent series to analyze the generating functions of the mean values of multiplicative functions.

Abstract: A new model of physics, with a hidden conformal sector which manifests itself as an unparticle coupling to Standard Model particles effectively through higher dimensional operators, predicts strong collider signals due to unparticle self-interactions. We perform a complete analysis of the most spectacular of these signals at the hadron collider, pp -> 4photon and pp ->2photon,2gluon. These processes can go through the three-point unparticle self interactions as well as through some s and t channel diagrams with one and/or two unparticle exchanges. We study the contributions of individual diagrams classified with respect to the number of unparticle exchanges and discuss their effect on the cross sections at the Tevatron and the LHC. We also restrict the Tevatron bound on the unknown coefficient of the three-point unparticle correlator. With the availability of data from Tevatron, and the advent of the data emerging from the LHC, these interactions can provide a clear and strong indication of unparticle physics and distinguish this model from other beyond the standard model scenarios.

  Sr$_{n+1}$Ti$_n$O$_{3n+1}$
Abstract: We have discovered from first-principles an unusual polar state in the low n Sr$_{n+1}$Ti$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) layered perovskites in which ferroelectricity is nearly degenerate with antiferroelectricity, a relatively rare form of ferroic order. We show that epitaxial strain plays a key role in tuning the "perpendicular coherence length" of the ferroelectric mode, and does not induce ferroelectricity in these low dimensional RP materials as is well known to occur in SrTiO$_3$. These systems present an opportunity to manipulate the coherence length of a ferroic distortion in a controlled way, without disorder or a free surface.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a number of extensions to Razborov's semidefinite flag algebra method. We will begin by showing how to apply the method to significantly improve the upper bounds of edge and vertex Tur\'an density type results for hypercubes. We will then introduce an improvement to the method which can be applied in a more general setting, notably to 3-uniform hypergraphs, to get a new upper bound of 0.5615 for $\pi(K_4^3)$.   For hypercubes we improve Thomason and Wagner's result on the upper bound of the edge Tur\'an density of a 4-cycle free subcube to 0.60318 and Chung's result on forbidding 6-cycles to 0.36577. We also show that the upper bound of the vertex Tur\'an density of $\mc{Q}_3$ can be improved to 0.76900, and that the vertex Tur\'an density of $\mc{Q}_3$ with one vertex removed is precisely 2/3.

Abstract: In this paper, an idea to solve nonlinear equations is presented. During the solution of any problem with Newton's Method, it might happen that some of the unknowns satisfy the convergence criteria where the others fail. The convergence happens only when all variables reach to the convergence limit. A method to reduce the dimension of the overall system by excluding some of the unknowns that satisfy an intermediate tolerance is introduced. In this approach, a smaller system is solved in less amount of time and already established local solutions are preserved and kept as constants while the other variables that belong to the "set" will be relaxed. To realize the idea, an algorithm is given that utilizes applications of pointers to reduce and evaluate the sets. Matrix-free Newton-Krylov Techniques are used on a test problem and it is shown that proposed idea improves the overall convergence.

Abstract: The Tur\'an number of an r-uniform hypergraph H is the maximum number of edges in any r-graph on n vertices which does not contain H as a subgraph. Let P_l^(r) denote the family of r-uniform loose paths on l edges, F(k,l) denote the family of hypergraphs consisting of k disjoint paths from P_l^(r), and P'_l^(r) denote an r-uniform linear path on l edges. We determine precisely ex_r(n;F(k,l)) and ex_r(n;k*P'_l^(r)), as well as the Tur\'an numbers for forests of paths of differing lengths (whether these paths are loose or linear) when n is appropriately large dependent on k,l,r, for r>=3. Our results build on recent results of F\"uredi, Jiang, and Seiver who determined the extremal numbers for individual paths, and provide more hypergraphs whose Turan numbers are exactly determined.

The exclusion plot on the coupling constant $g_{\rm B-L}$ and the dark photon mass $M_{A^\prime}$ is obtained. It is shown that contributions of interference term between the dark photon and the Standard Model are important. The interference effects are studied and compared with for data sets from TEXONO, GEMMA, BOREXINO, LSND as well as CHARM II experiments. Our results provide more stringent bounds to some regions of parameter space.

Abstract: Lorentz and CPT violation in the photon sector with the operators of arbitrary mass dimension has been proposed in the context of Standard-Model Extension. The CPT-odd subset of this enlarged model is investigated from a quantum-field theoretical point of view. The generic forms of dispersion relations, polarization vectors and the propagators are obtained for this special subset. Particularly, the general vacuum-orthogonal model is analyzed and it is demonstrated that the vacuum orthogonal model remains vacuum orthogonal at all orders. Although the model has birefringent solutions, they are shown to be spurious. Furthermore, the relevant polarization vectors are shown to be conventional. Leading order model is explicitly analyzed and it is demonstrated that there exists a nontrivial coefficient space satisfying above properties.

  back-contacted solar cells by laser processing
Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells with an interdigitated back-contact (IBC) exhibit high conversion efficiencies of up to 25.6%. However, due to the sophisticated back-side pattern of the doped layers and electrode structure many processing and patterning steps are required. A simplification of the patterning steps could ideally increase the yield and/or lower the production costs. We propose a patterning approach for IBC SHJ solar cells free of any photo-lithography with the help of laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) of the individual layer stacks to create the required back-contact pattern. The concept has the potential to lower the number of processing steps significantly while at the same time giving a large degree of freedom in the processing conditions optimization of emitter and BSF since deposition of the intrinsic/doped layers and processing of the wafer are all independent from each other.

Abstract: We study the magnetically-induced phonon splitting in cubic ACr$_2$O$_4$ (A=Mg, Zn, Cd, Hg) spinels from first principles, and demonstrate that the sign of the splitting, which is experimentally observed to be opposite in CdCr$_2$O$_4$ compared to ZnCr$_2$O$_4$ and MgCr$_2$O$_4$, is determined solely by the particular magnetic ordering pattern observed in these compounds. We further show that this interaction between magnetism and phonon frequencies can be fully described by the previously proposed spin-phonon coupling model that includes only the nearest neighbor exchange. Finally, using this model with materials specific parameters calculated from first principles, we provide additional insights into the physics of spin-phonon coupling in this intriguing family of compounds.

  Considerations for New Materials
Abstract: The recent observation of a ferroelectric-like structural transition in metallic LiOsO$_3$ has generated a flurry of interest in the properties of polar metals. Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO$_3$ and both insulating and electron-doped ATiO$_3$ perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO$_3$ (which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO$_3$ and LiOsO$_3$ emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and this mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising avenues for further research.

Abstract: Energy storage becomes crucial for energy systems with an increasing share of renewable energy sources. Artificial photosynthesis, in particular photovoltaic water splitting, provides both sustainable energy generation and energy storage in the form of hydrogen. However, only a few concepts for scalable devices were reported in the literature. Here, we introduce a new concept which, by design, is scalable and compatible with every thin-film photovoltaic technology. The concept allows for independent geometrical optimization of the photovoltaic and the electrochemical part. The scalability is achieved by continuous mirroring of a base unit. We demonstrate a fully integrated, wireless device with a stable and bias-free operation for 40 hours. The concept was scaled to an area of 64 cm2 comprising 13 base units and exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 3.9%. The concept and its successful realization is an important contribution towards the large scale application of artificial photosynthesis.

  of LaCoO$_3$
Abstract: The spin state transition in LaCoO$_3$ has eluded description for decades despite concerted theoretical and experimental effort. In this study, we approach this problem using fully charge self-consistent Density Functional Theory + Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT). We show from first principles that LaCoO$_3$ cannot be described by a single, pure spin state at any temperature. Instead, we observe a gradual change in the population of higher spin multiplets with increasing temperature, with the high spin multiplets being excited at the onset of the spin state transition followed by the intermediate spin multiplets being excited at the metal insulator transition temperature. We explicitly elucidate the critical role of lattice expansion and oxygen octahedral rotations in the spin state transition. We also reproduce, from first principles, that the spin state transition and the metal-insulator transition in LaCoO$_3$ occur at different temperature scales. In addition, our results shed light on the importance of electronic entropy in driving the spin state transition, which has so far been ignored in all first principles studies of this material.

  Endoscopic Capsule Robots
Abstract: We present a robust deep learning based 6 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) localization system for endoscopic capsule robots. Our system mainly focuses on localization of endoscopic capsule robots inside the GI tract using only visual information captured by a mono camera integrated to the robot. The proposed system is a 23-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that is capable to estimate the pose of the robot in real time using a standard CPU. The dataset for the evaluation of the system was recorded inside a surgical human stomach model with realistic surface texture, softness, and surface liquid properties so that the pre-trained CNN architecture can be transferred confidently into a real endoscopic scenario. An average error of 7:1% and 3:4% for translation and rotation has been obtained, respectively. The results accomplished from the experiments demonstrate that a CNN pre-trained with raw 2D endoscopic images performs accurately inside the GI tract and is robust to various challenges posed by reflection distortions, lens imperfections, vignetting, noise, motion blur, low resolution, and lack of unique landmarks to track.

The performance of the method is demonstrated using an ex-vivo porcine stomach model. Across four trajectories of varying speed and complexity, and across three cameras, the root mean square localization errors range from 0.42 to 1.92 cm, and the root mean square surface reconstruction errors range from 1.23 to 2.39 cm.

Abstract: Ingestible wireless capsule endoscopy is an emerging minimally invasive diagnostic technology for inspection of the GI tract and diagnosis of a wide range of diseases and pathologies. Medical device companies and many research groups have recently made substantial progresses in converting passive capsule endoscopes to active capsule robots, enabling more accurate, precise, and intuitive detection of the location and size of the diseased areas. Since a reliable real time pose estimation functionality is crucial for actively controlled endoscopic capsule robots, in this study, we propose a monocular visual odometry (VO) method for endoscopic capsule robot operations. Our method lies on the application of the deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs) for the visual odometry task, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used for the feature extraction and inference of dynamics across the frames, respectively. Detailed analyses and evaluations made on a real pig stomach dataset proves that our system achieves high translational and rotational accuracies for different types of endoscopic capsule robot trajectories.

  Environment Considering a Partially Covering Receiver
Abstract: By considering potential health problems that a fully covering receiver may cause in vessel-like environments, the implementation of a partially covering receiver is needed. To this end, distribution of hitting location of messenger molecules (MM) is analyzed within the context of molecular communication via diffusion with the aim of channel modeling. The distribution of these MMs for a fully covering receiver is analyzed in two parts: angular and radial dimensions. For the angular distribution analysis, the receiver is divided into 180 slices to analyze the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of these slices. For the axial distance distribution analysis, Kolmogorov- Smirnov test is applied for different significance levels. Also, two different implementations of the reflection from the vessel surface (i.e., rollback and elastic reflection) are compared and mathematical representation of elastic reflection is given. The results show that MMs have tendency to spread uniformly beyond a certain ratio of the distance to the vessel radius. By utilizing the uniformity, we propose a channel model for the partially covering receiver in vessel-like environments and validate the proposed model by simulations.

We establish the supervision by warping view sequences and assigning the re-projection minimization to the loss function, which we adopt in multi-view pose estimation and single-view depth estimation network. Detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed framework performed on non-rigidly deformable ex-vivo porcine stomach datasets proves the effectiveness of the method in terms of motion estimation and depth recovery.

Abstract: Reliable and real-time 3D reconstruction and localization functionality is a crucial prerequisite for the navigation of actively controlled capsule endoscopic robots as an emerging, minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic technology for use in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we propose a fully dense, non-rigidly deformable, strictly real-time, intraoperative map fusion approach for actively controlled endoscopic capsule robot applications which combines magnetic and vision-based localization, with non-rigid deformations based frame-to-model map fusion. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using four different ex-vivo porcine stomach models. Across different trajectories of varying speed and complexity, and four different endoscopic cameras, the root mean square surface reconstruction errors 1.58 to 2.17 cm.

Abstract: Iridates abound with interesting magnetic behaviours because of their strong spin-orbit coupling. Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$ brings together the spin-orbital entanglement of the Ir$^{4+}$ ion with a 3$d$ Ni cation and a one-dimensional crystal structure. It has a ferrimagnetic ground state with a 55 T coercive field. We perform a theoretical study of the magnetic interactions in this compound, and elucidate the role of anisotropic symmetric exchange as the source of its strong magnetic anisotropy. Our first-principles calculations reproduce the magnon spectra of this compound and predict a signature in the cross sections that can differentiate the anisotropic exchange from single-ion anisotopy.

Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Turan sieve and the simple sieve developed by R. Murty and the first author to study problems in random graph theory. In particular, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the probability of a graph on n vertices having diameter 2 (or diameter 3 in the case of bipartite graphs) with edge probability p(n) where the edges are chosen independently . An interesting feature revealed in these results is that the Turan sieve and the simple sieve `almost completely' complement each other. As a corollary to our result, we note that the probability of a random graph having diameter 2 approaches 1 as n approaches infinity for constant edge probability p(n)=1/2. This is an appendix of a shorter version of this paper.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the potential benefits from smart charging for a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) providing autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) services. We first consider a profit-maximizing platform operator who makes decisions for routing, charging, rebalancing, and pricing for rides based on a network flow model. Clearly, each of these decisions directly influence the fleet's smart charging potential; however, it is not possible to directly characterize the effects of various system parameters on smart charging under a classical network flow model. As such, we propose a modeling variation that allows us to decouple the charging and routing problems faced by the operator. This variation allows us to provide closed-form mathematical expressions relating the charging costs to the maximum battery capacity of the vehicles as well as the fleet operational costs. We show that investing in larger battery capacities and operating more vehicles for rebalancing reduces the charging costs, while increasing the fleet operational costs. Hence, we study the trade-off the operator faces, analyze the minimum cost fleet charging strategy, and provide numerical results illustrating the smart charging benefits to the operator.

  Perovskite Oxides
Abstract: A novel approach for finding new transparent conductors involves taking advantage of electronic correlations in metallic transition metal oxides, such as SrVO$_3$, to enhance the electronic effective mass and suppress the plasma frequency ($\omega_P$) to infrared. Success of this approach relies on finding a compound with the right electron effective mass and quasiparticle weight $Z$. Biaxial strain can in principle be a fruitful way to manipulate the electronic properties of materials to tune both of these quantities. In this study, we elucidate the behavior of the electronic properties of early transition metal oxides SrVO$_3$, SrNbO$_3$, and SrMoO$_3$ under strain, using first principles density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory. We show that strain is not an effective way to manipulate the plasma frequency, but dimensionality of the crystal structure and origin of electronic correlations strongly affect the trends in both $\omega_P$ and $Z$.

  Allocation
Abstract: Distributed algorithms for multi-agent resource allocation can provide privacy and scalability over centralized algorithms in many cyber-physical systems. However, the distributed nature of these algorithms can render these systems vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that can lead to non-convergence and infeasibility of resource allocation schemes. In this paper, we propose attack-resilient distributed algorithms based on primal-dual optimization when Byzantine attackers are present in the system. In particular, we design attack-resilient primal-dual algorithms for static and dynamic impersonation attacks by means of robust statistics. For static impersonation attacks, we formulate a robustified optimization model and show that our algorithm guarantees convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution of the robustified problem. On the other hand, a robust optimization model is not required for the dynamic impersonation attack scenario and we are able to design an algorithm that is shown to converge to a near-optimal solution of the original problem. We analyze the performances of our algorithms through both theoretical and computational studies.

  versus Electrostatic Gating
Abstract: Recent advances in electrostatic gating provide a novel way to modify the carrier concentration in materials via electrostatic means instead of chemical doping, thus minimizing the impurity scattering. Here, we use first-principles Density Functional Theory combined with a tight-binding approach to compare and contrast the effects of electrostatic gating and Co chemical doping on the ferromagnetic transition of FeS$_2$, a transition metal disulfide with the pyrite structure. Using tight-binding parameters obtained from maximally-localized Wannier functions, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility across a wide doping range. We find that electrostatic gating requires a higher electron concentration than the equivalent in Co doping to induce ferromagnetism via a Stoner-like mechanism. We attribute this behavior to the formation of a narrow Co band near the bottom of the conduction band under chemical doping, which is absent in the electrostatic gating case. Our results reveal that the effects of electrostatic gating go beyond a simple rigid band shift, and highlight the importance of the changes in the crystal structure promoted by gating.

Abstract: Consensusability is an important property for many multi-agent systems (MASs) as it implies the existence of networked controllers driving the states of MAS subsystems to the same value. Consensusability is of interest even when the MAS subsystems are physically coupled, which is the case for real-world systems such as power networks. In this paper, we study necessary and sufficient conditions for the consensusability of linear interconnected MASs. These conditions are given in terms of the parameters of the subsystem matrices, as well as the eigenvalues of the physical and communication graph Laplacians. Our results show that weak coupling between subsystems and fast information diffusion rates in the physical and communication graphs favor consensusability. Technical results are verified through computer simulations.

Abstract: Double perovskites extend the design space for new materials, and they often host phenomena that don't exist in their parent perovskite compounds. Here, we present a detailed first principles study of the correlated double perovskite Sr$_2$VNbO$_6$, where inter-cationic charge transfer and strength of electronic correlations depend strongly on the cation order. By using Density Functional Theory + Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we show that this compound has a completely different electronic structure than either of its parent compounds despite V and Nb being from the same group in the periodic table. We explain how the electronic correlations' effect on the crystal structural parameters determines on which side of the Hund's metal-Mott insulator transition the material is. Our results demonstrate the emergence of Hund's metallic behavior in a double perovskite that has $d^1$ parents, and underlines the importance of electronic correlation effects on the crystal structure.

  Colliders
Abstract: We study $Z'$ phenomenology at hadron colliders in an $U(1)'$ extended MSSM. We choose a $U(1)'$ model with a secluded sector, where the tension between the electroweak scale and developing a large enough mass for $Z'$ is resolved by incorporating three additional singlet superfields into the model. We perform a detailed analysis of the production, followed by decays, including into supersymmetric particles, of a $Z'$ boson with mass between 4 and 5.2 TeV, with particular emphasis on its possible discovery. We select three different scenarios consistent with the latest available experimental data and relic density constraints, and concentrate on final signals with two leptons, four leptons and six leptons. Including the SM background from processes with two, three or four vector bosons, we show the likelihood of observing a $Z^\prime$ boson is not promising for the HL-LHC at 14 TeV. While at 27 and 100 TeV, the situation is more optimistic, and we devise specific benchmark scenarios which could be observed.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impacts of competition in autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. By adopting a network-flow based formulation, we first determine the optimal strategies of profit-maximizing platform operators in monopoly and duopoly markets, including the optimal prices of rides. Furthermore, we characterize the platform operator's profits and the consumer surplus. We show that for the duopoly, the equilibrium prices for rides have to be symmetric between the firms. Then, in order to study the benefits of introducing competition in the market, we derive universal theoretical bounds on the ratio of prices for rides, aggregate demand served, profits of the firms, and consumer surplus between the monopolistic and the duopolistic setting. We discuss how consumers' firm loyalty affects each of the aforementioned metrics. Finally, using the Manhattan network and demand data, we quantify the efficacy of static pricing and routing policies and compare it to real-time model predictive policies.

  Corrupted Subgradients
Abstract: Numerous modern optimization and machine learning algorithms rely on subgradient information being trustworthy and hence, they may fail to converge when such information is corrupted. In this paper, we consider the setting where subgradient information may be arbitrarily corrupted (with a given probability) and study the robustness properties of the normalized subgradient method. Under the probabilistic corruption scenario, we prove that the normalized subgradient method, whose updates rely solely on directional information of the subgradient, converges to a minimizer for convex, strongly convex, and weakly-pseudo convex functions satisfying certain conditions. Numerical evidence on linear regression and logistic classification problems support our results.

  Conformational and dynamic effects in the polar cycloaddition of
  2,3-dibromobutadiene radical ions with maleic anhydride
Abstract: The kinetics, dynamics and conformational specificities for the ionic Diels-Alder reaction (polar cycloaddition) of maleic anhydride with 2,3-dibromobutadiene radical ions have been studied theoretically using multisurface adiabatic reactive molecular dynamics. A competition of concerted and stepwise reaction pathways was found and both the s-cis and s-trans conformers of of the diene are reactive. The analysis of the minimum dynamic path of the reaction indicates that both, rotations and vibrations of the reactant molecules are important for driving the system towards the transition state. The rates were computed as $k = 5.1 \times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ for the s-cis and $k = 3.8 \times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ for the s-trans conformer of 2,3-dibromobutadiene at an internal temperature of 300 K. The present results are to be contrasted with the neutral variant of the title system in which only the gauche conformer of the diene was found to undergo a considerably slower, concerted and mostly synchronous reaction driven by the excitation of rotations. The results presented here inform detailed experimental studies of the dynamics of polar cycloadditions under single-collision conditions in the gas phase.

  Simultaneous Stabilization
Abstract: Consensusability of multi-agent systems (MASs) certifies the existence of a distributed controller capable of driving the states of each subsystem to a consensus value. We study the consensusability of linear interconnected MASs (LIMASs) where, as in several real-world applications, subsystems are physically coupled. We show that consensusability is related to the simultaneous stabilizability of multiple LTI systems, and present a novel sufficient condition in form of a linear program for verifying this property. We also derive several necessary and sufficient consensusability conditions for LIMASs in terms of parameters of the subsystem matrices and the eigenvalues of the physical and communication graph Laplacians. The results show that weak physical couplings among subsystems and densely-connected physical and communication graphs are favorable for consensusability. Finally, we validate our results through simulations of networks of supercapacitors and DC microgrids.

  Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br
Abstract: Low dimensional spin-1/2 transition metal oxides and oxyhalides continue to be at the forefront of research investigating nonclassical phases such as quantum spin liquids. In this study, we examine the magnetic properties of the oxyhalide $\text{Cu}_2\text{(OH)}_3\text{Br}$ in the botallackite structure using first-principles density functional theory, linear spin-wave theory, and exact diagonalization calculations. This quasi-2D system consists of $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ $\mathrm{S} = 1/2$ moments arranged on a distorted triangular lattice. Our exact diagonalization calculations, which rely on a first-principles-based magnetic model, generate spectral functions consistent with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. By performing computational experiments to disentangle the chemical and steric effects of the halide ions, we find that the dominant effect of the halogen ions is steric in the $\text{Cu}_2\text{(OH)}_3\text{X}$ series of compounds.

Abstract: We combine infrared absorption and Raman scattering spectroscopies to explore the properties of the heavy transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-HfS$_2$. We employ the LO-TO splitting of the $E_u$ vibrational mode along with a reevaluation of mode mass, unit cell volume, and dielectric constant to reveal the Born effective charge. We find $Z^*_{\rm{B}}$ = 5.3$e$, in excellent agreement with complementary first principles calculations. In addition to resolving controversy over the nature of chemical bonding in this system, we decompose Born charge into polarizability and local charge. We find $\alpha$ = 5.07 \AA$^3$ and $Z^{*}$ = 5.2$e$, respectively. Polar displacement-induced charge transfer from sulfur $p$ to hafnium $d$ is responsible for the enhanced Born charge compared to the nominal 4+ in hafnium. 1T-HfS$_2$ is thus an ionic crystal with strong and dynamic covalent effects. Taken together, our work places the vibrational properties of 1T-HfS$_2$ on a firm foundation and opens the door to understanding the properties of tubes and sheets.

Each of these models is uniform in that all edges have the same internal structure, and each is simple in that no loops or multiedges are allowed. We generalize the concepts of Turan density, blowup density, and jumps to this class and show that many basic extremal results extend naturally in this new setting. In particular, we show that supersaturation holds, the blowup of a generalized directed hypergraph (GDH) has the same Turan density as the GDH itself, and degenerate GDHs (those with Turan density zero) can be characterized as being contained in a blowup of a single edge. Additionally, we show how the set of jumps from one kind of GDH relates to the set of jumps of another. Since r-uniform hypergraphs are an instance of the defined class, then we are able to derive many particular instances of jumps and nonjumps for GDHs in general based on known results.\nAuthors: Alex Cameron\nPublished: 2016-07-18T01:35:31Z\n', 'metadata': {'authors': 'Alex Cameron', 'published': '2016-07-18T01:35:31Z', 'categories': 'math.CO', 'title': 'Extremal Problems on Generalized Directed Hypergraphs', 'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04927v1'}}, {'rank': 5, 'similarity_score': 0.8337795734405518, 'content': 'Title: Spectral saturation: inverting the spectral Turan theorem\nAbstract: We prove that if the spectral radius of a graph G of order n is larger than the spectral radius of the r-partite Turan graph of the same order, then G contains various supergraphs of the complete graph of order r+1.

Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube.

Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube.
