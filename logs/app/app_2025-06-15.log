TITLE: A Study in a Hybrid Centralised-Swarm Agent Community
AUTHORS: Bradley van Aardt, Tshilidzi Marwala
ABSTRACT: Title: A Study in a Hybrid Centralised-Swarm Agent Community
 Abstract: This paper describes a systems architecture for a hybrid Centralised/Swarm based multi-agent system. The issue of local goal assignment for agents is investigated through the use of a global agent which teaches the agents responses to given situations. We implement a test problem in the form of a Pursuit game, where the Multi-Agent system is a set of captor agents. The agents learn solutions to certain board positions from the global agent if they are unable to find a solution. The captor agents learn through the use of multi-layer perceptron neural networks. The global agent is able to solve board positions through the use of a Genetic Algorithm. The cooperation between agents and the results of the simulation are discussed here. .

TITLE: Cooperative Tuning of Multi-Agent Optimal Control Systems
AUTHORS: Zehui Lu, Wanxin Jin, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian D. O. Anderson
ABSTRACT: Title: Cooperative Tuning of Multi-Agent Optimal Control Systems
 Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of cooperative tuning of multi-agent optimal control systems, where a network of agents (i.e. multiple coupled optimal control systems) adjusts parameters in their dynamics, objective functions, or controllers in a coordinated way to minimize the sum of their loss functions. Different from classical techniques for tuning parameters in a controller, we allow tunable parameters appearing in both the system dynamics and the objective functions of each agent. A framework is developed to allow all agents to reach a consensus on the tunable parameter, which minimizes team loss. The key idea of the proposed algorithm rests on the integration of consensus-based distributed optimization for a multi-agent system and a gradient generator capturing the optimal performance as a function of the parameter in the feedback loop tuning the parameter for each agent. Both theoretical results and simulations for a synchronous multi-agent rendezvous problem are provided to validate the proposed method for cooperative tuning of multi-agent optimal control.

ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-agent Performative Prediction with Greedy Deployment and Consensus
  Seeking Agents
 Abstract: We consider a scenario where multiple agents are learning a common decision vector from data which can be influenced by the agents' decisions. This leads to the problem of multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PfD). In this paper, we formulate Multi-PfD as a decentralized optimization problem that minimizes a sum of loss functions, where each loss function is based on a distribution influenced by the local decision vector. We first prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the Multi-PfD problem to admit a unique multi-agent performative stable (Multi-PS) solution. We show that enforcing consensus leads to a laxer condition for the existence of Multi-PS solution with respect to the distributions' sensitivities, compared to the single agent case. Then, we study a decentralized extension to the greedy deployment scheme [Mendler-D\"unner et al., 2020], called the DSGD-GD scheme. We show that DSGD-GD converges to the Multi-PS solution and analyze its non-asymptotic convergence rate. Numerical results validate our analysis.

TITLE: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
AUTHORS: Maude J. Blondin, Matthew Hale
ABSTRACT: Title: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
 Abstract: Multi-agent optimization problems with many objective functions have drawn much interest over the past two decades. Many works on the subject minimize the sum of objective functions, which implicitly carries a decision about the problem formulation. Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted sum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network. Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice of weights impacts the agents' final result.

TITLE: Interaction-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Agents

AUTHORS: Anahita Mohseni-Kabir, David Isele, Kikuo Fujimura
ABSTRACT: Title: Interaction-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Agents
  with Individual Goals
 Abstract: In a multi-agent setting, the optimal policy of a single agent is largely dependent on the behavior of other agents. We investigate the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning, focusing on decentralized learning in non-stationary domains for mobile robot navigation. We identify a cause for the difficulty in training non-stationary policies: mutual adaptation to sub-optimal behaviors, and we use this to motivate a curriculum-based strategy for learning interactive policies. The curriculum has two stages. First, the agent leverages policy gradient algorithms to learn a policy that is capable of achieving multiple goals. Second, the agent learns a modifier policy to learn how to interact with other agents in a multi-agent setting. We evaluated our approach on both an autonomous driving lane-change domain and a robot navigation domain.

ABSTRACT: Title: Development of a Multi-Agent System for Optimal Sizing of a Commercial
  Complex Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on a multi-agent system (MAS) is applied to the problem of optimal sizing in a stand-alone office complex microgrid such that the electricity demand of the office building and the charging demand of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging station are met. The proposed MAS-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical load agent (LA), PHEV charging station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. In the proposed MAS, control agent coordinates the interactions between the generation agent and electrical load and charging station agents and following a request from design agent, sends the information on the operation of the microgrid with determined sizes to the design agent. According to the received information, design agent finds the optimal sizes of the system's components such that the electricity and charging demands are met considering two reliability indices to investment decisions. This study is performed for Kish Island in south Iran.

ABSTRACT: Title: An agent framework for dynamic agent retraining: Agent academy
 Abstract: Agent Academy (AA) aims to develop a multi-agent society that can train new agents for specific or general tasks, while constantly retraining existing agents in a recursive mode. The system is based on collecting information both from the environment and the behaviors of the acting agents and their related successes/failures to generate a body of data, stored in the Agent Use Repository, which is mined by the Data Miner module, in order to generate useful knowledge about the application domain. Knowledge extracted by the Data Miner is used by the Agent Training Module as to train new agents or to enhance the behavior of agents already running. In this paper the Agent Academy framework is introduced, and its overall architecture and functionality are presented. Training issues as well as agent ontologies are discussed. Finally, a scenario, which aims to provide environmental alerts to both individuals and public authorities, is described an AA-based use case.

AUTHORS: Jieting Luo, Beishui Liao, John-Jules Meyer
ABSTRACT: Title: A Formal Framework for Reasoning about Agents' Independence in
  Self-organizing Multi-agent Systems
 Abstract: Self-organization is a process where a stable pattern is formed by the cooperative behavior between parts of an initially disordered system without external control or influence. It has been introduced to multi-agent systems as an internal control process or mechanism to solve difficult problems spontaneously. However, because a self-organizing multi-agent system has autonomous agents and local interactions between them, it is difficult to predict the behavior of the system from the behavior of the local agents we design. This paper proposes a logic-based framework of self-organizing multi-agent systems, where agents interact with each other by following their prescribed local rules. The dependence relation between coalitions of agents regarding their contributions to the global behavior of the system is reasoned about from the structural and semantic perspectives. We show that the computational complexity of verifying such a self-organizing multi-agent system is in exponential time. We then combine our framework with graph theory to decompose a system into different coalitions located in different layers, which allows us to verify agents' full contributions more efficiently. The resulting information about agents' full contributions allows us to understand the complex link between local agent behavior and system level behavior in a self-organizing multi-agent system. Finally, we show how we can use our framework to model a constraint satisfaction problem.

ABSTRACT: Title: AI Agent for Education: von Neumann Multi-Agent System Framework
 Abstract: The development of large language models has ushered in new paradigms for education. This paper centers on the multi-Agent system in education and proposes the von Neumann multi-Agent system framework. It breaks down each AI Agent into four modules: control unit, logic unit, storage unit, and input-output devices, defining four types of operations: task deconstruction, self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation. Furthermore, it introduces related technologies such as Chain-of-Thought, Reson+Act, and Multi-Agent Debate associated with these four types of operations. The paper also discusses the ability enhancement cycle of a multi-Agent system for education, including the outer circulation for human learners to promote knowledge construction and the inner circulation for LLM-based-Agents to enhance swarm intelligence. Through collaboration and reflection, the multi-Agent system can better facilitate human learners' learning and enhance their teaching abilities in this process.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

TITLE: Multi-Layers Supply chain modelling based on Multi-Agent Approach
AUTHORS: Samia Chehbi-Gamoura, Yacine Ouzrout, Abdelaziz Bouras
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-Layers Supply chain modelling based on Multi-Agent Approach
 Abstract: This paper proposes a strategic multi layers model based on multi agents approach for supply chain system. It introduces a formulation and a solution methodology for the problem of supply chain design and modeling. In this paper we describe and analyze the relationships among main entities of a supply chain, such as suppliers, producers, and distribution centers, in the aim to design the agents and define their behavior. We also study, how these relationships can be formulated in a multi layer model. Finally, a generic multi agent model is illustrated.
