TITLE: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
AUTHORS: David Lillis, Rem W. Collier`
ABSTRACT: Title: Augmenting Agent Platforms to Facilitate Conversation Reasoning
 Abstract: Within Multi Agent Systems, communication by means of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) has a key role to play in the co-operation, co-ordination and knowledge-sharing between agents. Despite this, complex reasoning about agent messaging, and specifically about conversations between agents, tends not to have widespread support amongst general-purpose agent programming languages.   ACRE (Agent Communication Reasoning Engine) aims to complement the existing logical reasoning capabilities of agent programming languages with the capability of reasoning about complex interaction protocols in order to facilitate conversations between agents. This paper outlines the aims of the ACRE project and gives details of the functioning of a prototype implementation within the Agent Factory multi agent framework.

TITLE: Multi-agent based protection system for distribution system with DG
AUTHORS: Jin Shang, Nengling Tai, Qi Liu
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-agent based protection system for distribution system with DG
 Abstract: This paper introduces the basic structure of multi-agent based protection system for distribution system with DGs. The entire system consists of intelligent agents and communication system. Intelligent agents can be divided into three layers, the bottom layer, the middle layer and the upper layer. The design of the agent in different layer is analyzed in detail. Communication system is the bridge of multi-agent system (MAS). The transmission mode, selective communication and other principles are discussed to improve the transmission efficiency. Finally, some evaluations are proposed, which provides the design of MAS with reference.

TITLE: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
AUTHORS: V. Botti
ABSTRACT: Title: Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?
 Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

ABSTRACT: Title: Persistent And Scalable JADE: A Cloud based InMemory Multi-agent
  Framework
 Abstract: Multi-agent systems are often limited in terms of persistenceand scalability. This issue is more prevalent for applications inwhich agent states changes frequently. This makes the existingmethods less usable as they increase the agent's complexityand are less scalable. This research study has presented anovel in-memory agent persistence framework. Two prototypeshave been implemented, one using the proposed solution andthe other using an established agent persistency environment.Experimental results confirm that the proposed framework ismore scalable than existing approaches whilst providing asimilar level of persistency. These findings will help futurereal-time multiagent systems to become scalable and persistentin a dynamic cloud environment.

[PAPER 1]
TITLE: Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization with State-Dependent Communication
AUTHORS: Ilan Lobel, Asuman Ozdaglar, Diego Feijer
ABSTRACT: Title: Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization with State-Dependent Communication
 Abstract: We study distributed algorithms for solving global optimization problems in which the objective function is the sum of local objective functions of agents and the constraint set is given by the intersection of local constraint sets of agents. We assume that each agent knows only his own local objective function and constraint set, and exchanges information with the other agents over a randomly varying network topology to update his information state. We assume a state-dependent communication model over this topology: communication is Markovian with respect to the states of the agents and the probability with which the links are available depends on the states of the agents. In this paper, we study a projected multi-agent subgradient algorithm under state-dependent communication. The algorithm involves each agent performing a local averaging to combine his estimate with the other agents' estimates, taking a subgradient step along his local objective function, and projecting the estimates on his local constraint set. The state-dependence of the communication introduces significant challenges and couples the study of information exchange with the analysis of subgradient steps and projection errors. We first show that the multi-agent subgradient algorithm when used with a constant stepsize may result in the agent estimates to diverge with probability one. Under some assumptions on the stepsize sequence, we provide convergence rate bounds on a "disagreement metric" between the agent estimates. Our bounds are time-nonhomogeneous in the sense that they depend on the initial starting time. Despite this, we show that agent estimates reach an almost sure consensus and converge to the same optimal solution of the global optimization problem with probability one under different assumptions on the local constraint sets and the stepsize sequence.

TITLE: Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation,

ABSTRACT: Title: Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation,
  Principal--Agent with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics and multitask Principal--Agent
 Abstract: In this paper, we address three Principal--Agent problems in a moral hazard context and show that they are connected. We start by studying the problem of Principal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is manifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through Pareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the principal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov control problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we derive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for the principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step, we show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also converge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new Principal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the agent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract can depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the principal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov control problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an optimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection of these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a situation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a single agent.

TITLE: Multi-agent Performative Prediction with Greedy Deployment and Consensus

ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-agent Performative Prediction with Greedy Deployment and Consensus
  Seeking Agents
 Abstract: We consider a scenario where multiple agents are learning a common decision vector from data which can be influenced by the agents' decisions. This leads to the problem of multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PfD). In this paper, we formulate Multi-PfD as a decentralized optimization problem that minimizes a sum of loss functions, where each loss function is based on a distribution influenced by the local decision vector. We first prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the Multi-PfD problem to admit a unique multi-agent performative stable (Multi-PS) solution. We show that enforcing consensus leads to a laxer condition for the existence of Multi-PS solution with respect to the distributions' sensitivities, compared to the single agent case. Then, we study a decentralized extension to the greedy deployment scheme [Mendler-D\"unner et al., 2020], called the DSGD-GD scheme. We show that DSGD-GD converges to the Multi-PS solution and analyze its non-asymptotic convergence rate. Numerical results validate our analysis.

ABSTRACT: Title: A Multi-Agent Approach to Optimal Sizing of a Combined Heating and Power
  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

TITLE: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
AUTHORS: Maude J. Blondin, Matthew Hale
ABSTRACT: Title: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
 Abstract: Multi-agent optimization problems with many objective functions have drawn much interest over the past two decades. Many works on the subject minimize the sum of objective functions, which implicitly carries a decision about the problem formulation. Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted sum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network. Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice of weights impacts the agents' final result.

TITLE: A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for
  intelligent shopfloor
AUTHORS: Zhen Zhao, Dunbing Tang, Haihua Zhu, Zequn Zhang, Kai Chen, Changchun Liu, Yuchen Ji
ABSTRACT: Title: A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for
  intelligent shopfloor
 Abstract: As productivity advances, the demand of customers for multi-variety and small-batch production is increasing, thereby putting forward higher requirements for manufacturing systems. When production tasks frequent changes due to this demand, traditional manufacturing systems often cannot response promptly. The multi-agent manufacturing system is proposed to address this problem. However, because of technical limitations, the negotiation among agents in this kind of system is realized through predefined heuristic rules, which is not intelligent enough to deal with the multi-variety and small batch production. To this end, a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor is proposed in the present study. This system delineates the diverse agents and defines their collaborative methods. The roles of the agents encompass Machine Server Agent (MSA), Bid Inviter Agent (BIA), Bidder Agent (BA), Thinking Agent (TA), and Decision Agent (DA). Due to the support of LLMs, TA and DA acquire the ability of analyzing the shopfloor condition and choosing the most suitable machine, as opposed to executing a predefined program artificially. The negotiation between BAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources. With the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders, relying on the information of each machine returned by BA. MSAs bears the responsibility for connecting the agents with the physical shopfloor. This system aims to distribute and transmit workpieces through the collaboration of the agents with these distinct roles, distinguishing it from other scheduling approaches. Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of this system.

ABSTRACT: Title: Ontology-Based Feedback to Improve Runtime Control for Multi-Agent
  Manufacturing Systems
 Abstract: Improving the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of machines on the shop floor is crucial to ensure the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing systems. To achieve the goal of increased OEE, there is a need to develop flexible runtime control strategies for the system. Decentralized strategies, such as multi-agent systems, have proven effective in improving system flexibility. However, runtime multi-agent control of complex manufacturing systems can be challenging as the agents require extensive communication and computational efforts to coordinate agent activities. One way to improve communication speed and cooperation capabilities between system agents is by providing a common language between these agents to represent knowledge about system behavior. The integration of ontology into multi-agent systems in manufacturing provides agents with the capability to continuously update and refine their knowledge in a global context. This paper contributes to the design of an ontology for multi-agent systems in manufacturing, introducing an extendable knowledge base and a methodology for continuously updating the production data by agents during runtime. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study is conducted in a simulated environment, which shows improvements in OEE during runtime.

ABSTRACT: Title: PE-MA: Parameter-Efficient Co-Evolution of Multi-Agent Systems
 Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative reasoning and solving complex tasks. However, the design of collaborative learning algorithms in multi-agent systems faces several challenges, including high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level personalization. In this paper, we propose PE-MA (Parameter-Efficient Multi-Agent Co-Evolution), a novel collaboration framework that supports efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution in multi-agent systems. In PE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support agent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized across neighboring agents. This design balances global coordination with local adaptation under heterogeneous environments. We achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of O( 1/(NK)^(1/2) ), where N is the number of agents and K the local update steps.

TITLE: Dynamic exploration of multi-agent systems with timed periodic tasks
AUTHORS: Johan Arcile, Raymond Devillers, Hanna Klaudel
ABSTRACT: Title: Dynamic exploration of multi-agent systems with timed periodic tasks
 Abstract: We formalise and study multi-agent timed models MAPTs (Multi-Agent with timed Periodic Tasks), where each agent is associated to a regular timed schema upon which all possibles actions of the agent rely. MAPTs allow for an accelerated semantics and a layered structure of the state space, so that it is possible to explore the latter dynamically and use heuristics to greatly reduce the computation time needed to address reachability problems. We apply MAPTs to explore state spaces of autonomous vehicles and compare it with other approaches in terms of expressivity, abstraction level and computation time.

TITLE: AI Agent for Education: von Neumann Multi-Agent System Framework

ABSTRACT: Title: AI Agent for Education: von Neumann Multi-Agent System Framework
 Abstract: The development of large language models has ushered in new paradigms for education. This paper centers on the multi-Agent system in education and proposes the von Neumann multi-Agent system framework. It breaks down each AI Agent into four modules: control unit, logic unit, storage unit, and input-output devices, defining four types of operations: task deconstruction, self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation. Furthermore, it introduces related technologies such as Chain-of-Thought, Reson+Act, and Multi-Agent Debate associated with these four types of operations. The paper also discusses the ability enhancement cycle of a multi-Agent system for education, including the outer circulation for human learners to promote knowledge construction and the inner circulation for LLM-based-Agents to enhance swarm intelligence. Through collaboration and reflection, the multi-Agent system can better facilitate human learners' learning and enhance their teaching abilities in this process.

TITLE: How Can Creativity Occur in Multi-Agent Systems?
AUTHORS: Ted Fujimoto
ABSTRACT: Title: How Can Creativity Occur in Multi-Agent Systems?
 Abstract: Complex systems show how surprising and beautiful phenomena can emerge from structures or agents following simple rules. With the recent success of deep reinforcement learning (RL), a natural path forward would be to use the capabilities of multiple deep RL agents to produce emergent behavior of greater benefit and sophistication. In general, this has proved to be an unreliable strategy without significant computation due to the difficulties inherent in multi-agent RL training. In this paper, we propose some criteria for creativity in multi-agent RL. We hope this proposal will give artists applying multi-agent RL a starting point, and provide a catalyst for further investigation guided by philosophical discussion.

ABSTRACT: Title: Development of a Multi-Agent System for Optimal Sizing of a Commercial
  Complex Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on a multi-agent system (MAS) is applied to the problem of optimal sizing in a stand-alone office complex microgrid such that the electricity demand of the office building and the charging demand of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging station are met. The proposed MAS-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical load agent (LA), PHEV charging station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. In the proposed MAS, control agent coordinates the interactions between the generation agent and electrical load and charging station agents and following a request from design agent, sends the information on the operation of the microgrid with determined sizes to the design agent. According to the received information, design agent finds the optimal sizes of the system's components such that the electricity and charging demands are met considering two reliability indices to investment decisions. This study is performed for Kish Island in south Iran.

TITLE: Multi-agent Performative Prediction with Greedy Deployment and Consensus

AUTHORS: Qiang Li, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai
ABSTRACT: Title: Multi-agent Performative Prediction with Greedy Deployment and Consensus
  Seeking Agents
 Abstract: We consider a scenario where multiple agents are learning a common decision vector from data which can be influenced by the agents' decisions. This leads to the problem of multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PfD). In this paper, we formulate Multi-PfD as a decentralized optimization problem that minimizes a sum of loss functions, where each loss function is based on a distribution influenced by the local decision vector. We first prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the Multi-PfD problem to admit a unique multi-agent performative stable (Multi-PS) solution. We show that enforcing consensus leads to a laxer condition for the existence of Multi-PS solution with respect to the distributions' sensitivities, compared to the single agent case. Then, we study a decentralized extension to the greedy deployment scheme [Mendler-D\"unner et al., 2020], called the DSGD-GD scheme. We show that DSGD-GD converges to the Multi-PS solution and analyze its non-asymptotic convergence rate. Numerical results validate our analysis.

  Microgrid
 Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent based method is applied to the problem of optimal sizing of the components of an islanded combined heating and power residential microgrid such that the residential power and heat demands and hydrogen refilling demands of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are met. It is assumed that the proposed multi agent-based architecture consists of five different agents, namely generation agent (GA), electrical and thermal loads agent (LA), FCEV refilling station agent (SA), control agent (CA), and design agent (DA) which are organized in three levels. Design agent (DA) is the main agent of the proposed multi-agent system (MAS) that according to its interactions with CA and by minimizing the total costs of the system through particle swarm optimization (PSO), finds the optimal sizes of the system's components. This study is performed for a typical stand-alone combined heating and power microgrid.

TITLE: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization

ABSTRACT: Title: An Algorithm for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization
 Abstract: Multi-agent optimization problems with many objective functions have drawn much interest over the past two decades. Many works on the subject minimize the sum of objective functions, which implicitly carries a decision about the problem formulation. Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted sum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network. Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice of weights impacts the agents' final result.
